He was a man of masterful but cold and haughty personality, more interested in the diagnosis of disease than the treatment of his patients. It was even said that ‘he sometimes forgot to prescribe!’ Understandably, his practice never became large, and he was able to spend most of his time in teaching and in pathologic research. He had many medical interests. For example, he was the co-author of the first English book on poisons, he first described xanthoma, and he was a pioneer the use of static electricity in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Addison and Bright collaborated in writing an elementary textbook on medical practice but did not complete it.</p><p>“Addison is best known for his brilliant clinical accounts of pernicious anemia and Addison's disease. He first defined the syndrome of pernicious anemia to the south London Medical Society in 1849, although no formal report was printed. Later in the same year, he contributed a paper to the <i>London Medical Gazette</i> in which he described cases of pernicious anemia (until recently called ‘Addisonian pernicious anemia’). In the same paper, he presented three cases of weakness and pigmentation in which postmortem examination revealed destruction of the adrenal glands. He revised and expanded this paper and published a new version as a slim monograph, <i>Disease of the Supra-Renal Capsules</i>, six Years later when he was sixty years old. At that time, Addison’s account of the condition he called ‘melasma suprarenale’ was regarded as a scientific curiosity, but its importance to medical practice was soon realized, and his discussion of the ‘suprarenal syndrome’ became a foundation stone of modern endocrinology. Trousseau, his famous contemporary and a generous interpreter of other men's ideas, gave the syndrome the name ‘Addison’s disease.’</p><p>“This notable book is based on a series of detailed histories of eleven cases and is illustrated with accurate but rather coarsely drawn full-page colored plates” (Waife et al. 207).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Addison, Thomas, <i>A collection of the published writings of the late Thomas Addison, M.D., physician to Guy's Hospital</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17892706 ; Bethune, John E., <i>The adrenal cortex : a Scope monograph</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/3929653",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7435725,RC659 .A3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

There he continued his anatomic research and wrote in a more dynamic manner and with greater physiologic insight than had whose predecessors, whose approach had been essentially teleologic and descriptive. Although Aselli’s notebooks and jottings for lectures have never been published, he is renowned for this small volume, which was published two years after his death at the age of forty-five.</p><p>“The book records his chance discovery of the lacteal vessels in 1622 while he was displaying the mesenteric nerves the dog at an anatomic demonstration. In this fed animal, he noted a network of mesenteric vessels that contained a whitish fluid. Because such engorgement was absent and a fasting animal, he concluded that it was related to recent feeding.</p><p>“Writing before the publication of Harvey's work on the circulation, Aselli maintained that the liver was the center of the venous system and believed, as did Galen, that the intestinal veins carried chyle to the liver. Harvey knew that the Galenic account was wrong and remained skeptical about the existence of lacteals; The contradiction was cleared away when Jean Pecquet announced his discovery of the thoracic duct in 1651.</p><p>“In his text, which comprises thirty-five chapters, Aselli took up the intestines in general, their veins, arteries, nerves, and a 'fourth, new kind' of vessels. He explained why he had named the vessels he discovered 'lacteal,' or milky, vessels and asked Why they had remained undiscovered for so long. He presented their anatomy in great detail and wondered whether they were supplied with chyle or blood. He also described the transit of chyle to the liver and discussed the contribution of the new vessels to the formation of blood.</p><p>“The book was illustrated with a copper plate portrait of the author at the age of forty-two, when he made his discovery, and with four large foldout plates showing the lacteals and animal dissections. These are most remarkable woodcuts, both for their display of the dissections and for the method in which they were produced” (Waife et al. 61).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Bartholin, Thomas, <i>De lacteis thoracicis, in homine brutisque nuperrime observatis, historia anatomica</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15712534 ; Cruickshank, William, <i>The anatomy of the absorbing vessels of the human body</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15712556 ",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8604737,QM197 .A8,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He had carefully verified his findings by dissection before committing them to paper. The book begins with general chapters on chest diseases, then describes the special uses of his method, and includes fourteen case histories.</p><p>“Auenbrugger was gifted with a musical ear and distinguished the ‘drum’ sound emitted by the healthy chest from the higher ‘tympanitic’ sound, or the dull ‘flesh’ sound of a disease chest. By tapping over fluids which had been injected into the chests of cadavers, he established the percussion note characteristic of pleural effusion. Applying the technique in his practice, he was able to prove his diagnosis by thoracentesis. Although he gave notice ‘to all doctors’ that percussion ‘deserves first place after examining the pulse and respiration,’ his method was not adopted by van Swieten—the leading Viennese physician—his former teacher, nor by de Haen, physician to the Vienna Clinic. De Haen’s successor, Maximilian Stoll, took it up but died prematurely, and the procedure was dropped. Auenbrugger Had also expressed the wish that his method might prove ‘a solace of the wretched and an increase of their art for true cultivators of medicine.’ The book was translated into French in 1770, but the translation also was ignored.</p><p>“Although not widely followed, the new method of percussion was taught in several German University Medical schools and was adopted by some prominent physicians. Corvisart, Napoleon’s physician, learned of it from Stoll’s writings and mentioned his own success with it and his book; He followed this by editing Auenbrugger’s original text in a new French translation (1808). Nearly fifty years after Auenbrugger’s publication, Corvisart’s advocacy firmly established percussion as a necessary procedure for every physician.</p><p>“Auenbrugger retired from his hospital in 1762, had a distinguished career in private practice, and was ennobled in 1784 for his medical achievement. In 1783, he published a psychologic study of the urge to commit suicide, citing this urge as a real disease.</p><p>“As a distinguished member of the Viennese court, Auenbrugger delighted Empress Maria Theresa by writing a libretto for Salieri’s operetta, <i>The Chimney Sweep</i>.

Avid for knowledge, he became well versed in mathematics, jurisprudence, philosophy, and poetry. In fact, several quatrains ascribed to Omar Khayyam are believed to have been written more than a century earlier by Avicenna. At sixteen, he took up the study of medicine and, by eighteen, had already gained renown as a physician. He became court physician and vizier to several caliphs in the Persian city of Isfahan and was chief physician to the great hospital at Baghdad.</p><p>“Avicenna’s most influential work was the ‘Canon of Medicine,’ written in Arabic, in which he summarized the experience of the Greco-Roman physicians Hippocrates and Galen and added many personal observations. Avicenna realized that certain illnesses, such as tuberculosis and dysentery, are communicable. Of the latter he wrote, ‘disease is transmitted from person to person.... The traveler is more exposed to illness from the diversity of the drinking water than he is from the diversity of foods. Hence it is necessary to be particular about correcting the bad qualities of the drinking water, and expend every effort in purifying it. Boil the water, for as we have already pointed out, boiling sometimes clarifies the water and separates off the impurities which are mixed with the intrinsic substance of the water.’ Avicenna also recognized the genetic nature of certain conditions, stating, ‘Hereditary transmission includes premature baldness and gout.’</p><p>“This massive and encyclopedic book of almost a million words was used throughout the Arabic-speaking world until relatively modern times. No author, after Galen, enjoyed so wide and durable a reputation.</p><p>“The ‘Canon’ was translated into Latin for European physicians and reprinted many times in that language from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. Only during the Renaissance, when Western physicians gained direct access to the medical writings of the ancient Greeks, did the ‘Canon’ begin to decline in influence.</p><p>“The magnificent two-volume ‘Canon’ in the Lilly collection is in the original Arabic (although a Latin title page has been added) and includes some of Avicenna’s other scientific writings” (Waife et al. 53).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Avicenna, <i>al-Risālah al-alwāḥīyah</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1620571",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8009729,R128.3 .A9 v.1 - v.3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

His work was a link between the ‘nature philosophy’ of the eighteenth century and the precise inductive science of the nineteenth. This many-sided biologist was trained in botany and zoology as well as medicine. From 1819 to 1834, he taught at Konigsberg in East Prussia, where he made his original influential discoveries. He is best known for having found the mammalian ovum, which he detected in 1826 in the ovary of a dog and later in other mammals. He published this brief account of the formation of the egg of animals and man the next year.</p><p>“The book describes the beginnings of the fetus in the dog, the genesis of the ovum, the Graafian vesicles, and the embryonic development of mammals. His announcement that ‘every animal which springs from coition of male and female is developed from an ovum, not from a simple generative fluid,’ cleared away many theoretical contrary opinions. The results of his infinite meticulousness in refining the then rudimentary techniques of microscopy laid the foundations for the new field of Embryology and earned the profound admiration of his contemporaries.</p><p>“Von Baer continued his observations and elaborated his ‘reflections’ in the larger, unfinished two-volume work, <i>Über die Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere</i> (1828 and 1837). This title literally meant ‘the history and development of animals’ but soon acquired the technical connotation of ‘embryology.’ He first distinguished the germ layers and discovered the notochord (chorda dorsalis), transient structures of great importance in understanding embryonic development and the common genesis of vertebrates. Von Baer recognized the neural folds as rudiments of the nervous system and described the primary brain vesicles. He showed that all vertebrate embryos are more alike than their adult forms, since development proceeds from the general to the special, and thus discredited the widely held theory that all characteristics of the organism were ‘preformed’ in the ovum.</p><p>“Von Baer’s work provided a basis for systematic embryology. He was critical of Darwin’s theory of evolution, but his ideas had considerable influence on the contributions of embryologists to evolutionary theory.</p><p>“The last thirty years of his life were spent in Russia, where he devoted himself to studying the anthropology and physical geography of that country” (Waife et al. 181).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Baer, Karl Ernst von, <i>Autobiography of Dr. Karl Ernst von Baer</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1586927 ",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7473548,QL965.B14 D27,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Frederick Grant Banting (1891-1941) conceived an idea for achieving pancreatic control of diabetes almost by chance while working at London, Ontario, in 1920. J. J. R. Macleod (1876-1935), professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, an authority on carbohydrate metabolism, thought the problem intractable, because he knew of the unsuccessful research of workers in previous decades. Nevertheless, in May, 1921, he gave Banting financial support and laboratory space at the university and appointed Charles H. Best, a graduate student, to assist him. By August, they had produced a pancreatic extract that controlled the diabetes of a depancreatized dog; by January, 1922, they had made a crude extract from beef pancreas, and clinical trials had begun in human subjects.</p><p>“Macleod called in J. B. Collip, who contributed his biochemical expertise to purifying the new extract, Production of insulin in quantities suitable for clinical use was begun by American scientists in the laboratories of Eli Lilly and Company, and the practical treatment of diabetes was at hand.</p><p>“The first report on insulin research appeared in an article by Banting and Best in the February, 1922, issue of the <i>Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine</i>, and other journal articles followed. In January, 1923, Macleod and Banting recounted the history of the discovery in the Beaumont lectures given before the Wayne County Medical Society in Detroit, and these were published as a small book the next year. The first, delivered by Professor Macleod, was a historical review. It traced the development of knowledge about the pancreas from 1682 to the current time. The second lecture, also by Macleod, reviewed the Toronto laboratory experiments that led to the trial of insulin in man. The third and final lecture was given by Dr. Banting. After detailing aspects of the animal studies, he reported on the first clinical use of insulin in diabetic patients.</p><p>“Banting and Macleod were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1923.

It was profusely illustrated with large woodcuts made from the writer’s own colored drawings. In his role of ‘cutter,’ Bartisch wrote a similar treatise on lithotomy, which did not appear in print until modern times.</p><p>“His work resembles that of other German surgeons, such as Hieronymus Brunschwig or Caspar Stromayr, whose ‘Copious Practice in the Treatment of Hernia’ had been issued in 1559. Each was a complete picture book of practical methods of treatment. The pictures were drawn from life and crowded with detail; they represent individual cases, in contrast to the generalized prototypes that appear in contemporary French and Italian books. Where modern artist would depict only the particular part of the body subject to the operation, Bartisch displays a whole face, the full-length figure of the patient, or a group seen with the Sergeant and his assistant in attendance. Some of these portraits are repeated with slight variations to depict different conditions of the eyes. A few anatomic plates with hinged overlays show successive depths of dissection. Vesalius Had introduced this method in 1543, although it was not much exploited until the seventeenth century. Bartisch also pictures instruments and masks for treating strabismus.</p><p>“This oversize book is divided into sixteen sections that cover anatomy, defects and diseases of the eyes and sight (especially strabismus, cataract, running or pustulent conditions, and corneal damage), the eyelids and eyelashes, external injuries, pain in the eyes, and injuries caused by witches or the devil. In each case, the surgical or medical treatment is clearly explained. Bartisch concluded with sections on the care necessary to maintain health of the eyes, the effects of venesection and diet, methods of preparing the necessary medicines and ointments, a survey of instruments, and forms of religious thanksgiving for cure. In addition to its remarkable range, the book is notable for recording in detail the bold and dangerous operations undertaken by sixteenth-century surgeons” (Waife et al. 49).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1297063,RE46 .B2,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

A permanent gastric fistula formed in the wound, and Beaumont realized that St. Martin’s case offered a unique opportunity to investigate the process of digestion. He was able to view the contents of the stomach during digestion through the opening and to watch the action of gastric secretions. He began his observations in the spring of 1825 and initially reported them in the <i>Medical Recorder</i> of Philadelphia.</p><p>“During the next eight years, although St. Martin was often away hunting and fur trapping, sometimes deep in the Canadian wilds, and Beaumont was reassigned to remote posts in the Wisconsin wilderness, he was able from time to time to find St. Martin and continue his experiments. At one point, he persuaded his patient to travel to Plattsburgh, New York, where Beaumont was spending a leave, for a series of tests. Specimens of St. Martin’s gastric juice were sent for analysis to chemists as the University of Virginia and at Yale University. Both found free hydrochloric acid.</p><p>“The papers of 1825-1826 excited considerable interest, not the least in Europe, where Müller, Schwann, and Purkinje were influenced by the first report of Beaumont’s discovery. His book describing his studies in detail was printed in Plattsburgh in 1833. It was reprinted in Boston and translated into German the next year and was published again in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1838.</p><p>“Beaumont realized the value of his observations for gastric function, digestion, and the pathology of gastritis and suggested that there was some special secretion in the stomach in addition to the hydrochloric acid. This was confirmed in 1836, when Schwann discovered pepsin. Beaumont eventually lost touch with St. Martin, who is said to have survived some forty-five more years and to have fathered twenty children.</p><p>“This book, a remarkable example of brilliant clinical investigation performed under almost primitive conditions, represents a discovery that proved to be a major milestone in the field of physiology” (Waife et al. 185).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/3852437,QP151 .B37,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In the pamphlet, Bell maintained the different parts of the brain serve different functions. He had cut certain spinal-nerve roots in experimental animals and showed by the changes in their behavior that the nerves were anatomically ‘united for the convenience of distribution, but distinct in office.’ Such functional specificity, he deduced, was derived from the part of the brain with which the nerve was connected.</p><p>“‘On laying bare the roots of the spinal nerves,’ he wrote, ‘I found that I could cut across the posterior fasciculus of the nerves which took its origin from the posterior portion of the spinal marrow without convulsing the muscles of the back, but that, on touching the anterior fasciculus with the point of the knife, the muscles of the back were immediately convulsed.’ However, Bell failed to grasp the significance of this observation and classed all nerves as sensory, calling the posterior roots ‘sensible’ and the anterior roots ‘insensible.’ In a similar experiment eleven years later, Magendie provided clear proof that the anterior roots are motor, and Bell then accepted his findings.</p><p>“Bell was trained in Edinburgh but spent the busiest years of his active and productive life in London, where he was known as a surgeon, an anatomist, a teacher, and a writer. A two-volume <i>System of Operative Surgery</i> brought him fame and success. He later joined the school founded by John and William Hunter. His talent for sketching and drawing was useful to him in illustrating his medical works. He published additional papers on the nervous system and subsequently collected them in <i>The Nervous System</i> (1830). Bell was knighted in 1829 for his physiologic discoveries. He returned to his beloved Edinburgh in 1836 and held the chair of surgery at the University of Edinburgh until his death.</p><p>“Bell is remembered chiefly for his later demonstration of the sensory and motor functions of the fifth cranial nerve, for his discovery of the long thoracic nerve that bears his name, and for his description of the facial paralysis, known as Bell's palsy, which results from facial-nerve neuropathy” (Waife et al. 165). </p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7772482,QM455 .B4,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

There he continued Magendie's physiologic research with even greater intellectual power. He had started as a pharmacist's assistant in Lyons and, before qualifying as a physician, had had some success as a poet and playwright. The greatest of French physiologists, Bernard was the first scientist in his country to be honored with a public funeral at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.</p><p>“Bernard combined Magendie’s objectivity with enormous curiosity about the facts uncovered. That attitude is well summed up in his own words: ‘Put off your imagination, as you take off your overcoat, when you enter the laboratory; but put it on again, as you do your overcoat, when you leave the laboratory. Before the experiment and between whiles, let your imagination wrap you round; put it right away from you during the experiment itself lest it hinder your observing power.’ A contemporary of Charcot, Pasteur, Virchow, Addison, and Darwin, he lived during a period of intense scientific ferment.</p><p>“His classic book on experimental physiology laid the foundation for today’s understanding of physiology, metabolism, and endocrinology. It was based on his lectures, which were given in two courses in 1854 and 8155. In the first, after a preliminary exposition of the indivisibility of physiologic and pathologic research, Bernard described his investigation of glucose production, with special reference to diabetes. He had studied the chemistry of the liver and the blood and announced his discovery of the glycogenic function of the liver. The second course discussed the mechanical and chemical aspects of digestion, with emphasis on the chemistry and the digestive role of saliva and the properties and function of the pancreas.</p><p>“Bernard introduced the concept of ‘internal secretions’ and showed that all the relevant organs of the body cooperate in the general functions.

A professor of materia medica at Harvard from 1815 to 1855, he distinguished himself first as a botanist. He had studied under Benjamin Smith Barton, of Philadelphia, whose <i>Elements of Botany</i> (1803) was the first textbook on the subject published in the United States.

He was also an accomplished artist and musician. Three years after he had been appointed professor of surgery at Zurich in 1860, he published his course of lectures on surgical pathology and treatment in this ‘handbook for students and doctors,’ a work that was translated into many languages.</p><p>“Billroth was particularly concerned with wound infections and discussed the surgical care of various classes of injuries and the diseases of the tissues arising from them. The book is arranged in twenty chapters that encompass the subject matter of fifty lectures. It describes the pathology and cure of all sorts of lesions and is exceptionally complete.</p><p>“In 1867, Billroth moved to Vienna, where he was professor of surgery for more than twenty years. There he raised the medical school to a new peak of fame and taught many students who became leading surgeons of the next generation. He was a pioneer in surgery of the gastrointestinal tract and devised gastric operations for resection of the intestine in ulcers and in carcinomas of the stomach, surgical techniques that now bear his name. He was also the first surgeon to resect the esophagus and the first to perform a total laryngectomy.</p><p>“Curiously, this methodical man did not readily accept Lister’s findings and only belatedly appreciated the significance of the new science of bacteriology in relation to surgical sepsis.</p><p>“In addition to medicine, Billroth made contributions to the arts as a poet and a composer. His charming <i>Briefe</i> was written as a memorial to his lifelong friend, the composer Johannes Brahms, with whom he had played chamber music.</p><p>“Billroth’s book is regarded as important because, more than any other, it linked the practice of surgery to the study of pathologic anatomy. No one else had so carefully studied the tissues removed surgically, and his operations truly earned their description as ‘autopsies <i>in vivo</i>,’ a phrase that was coined in compliment” (Waife et al. 223).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RD30 .B59,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

It went through many editions and was translated even into Arabic and Turkish.</p><p>“Boerhaave (1668-1738) exerted tremendous influence on medicine and related disciplines; he was an inspired teacher of clinical medicine, an experimental chemist, a botanist, and a consultant whose competence was recognized throughout Europe. He is credited with systematizing and synthesizing medical knowledge.</p><p>“Boerhaave became a doctor of philosophy at the age of twenty-two and a doctor of physic at twenty-five. In 1701, when he was thirty-three, he was appointed lecturer in medicine at Leyden. Seven years later, his lectures were published in <i>Institutiones Medicae</i>; in the preface, Boerhaave describes the text as ‘a little book which draws the lines within which my annual work with you is confined.’ It is divided into four sections: physiology, pathology, hygiene, and therapeutics. The title was used as the accepted name for courses on physiology and medical schools until well into the nineteenth century. Although he was not a great writer, his book was successful because of its simplicity, clarity, and eclectic wisdom. His warm personality and oratory gifts made his lectures extremely popular. The many students who flocked to Leyden soon spread his teachings over Europe and America.</p><p>“Boerhaave revived the instruction methods of Hippocrates; He took his students to the bedside of the patient and, by skillful questioning, drew from them the information needed for diagnosing the disease. Although he had only twelve hospital beds at his disposal, he utilized them to the fullest; under his guidance, Leyden became the site of one of Europe’s most prestigious medical schools. Boerhaave also taught a private course on the theory of medical practice. The lectures from this course were published in <i>Aphorismi</i> in 1709.</p><p>“Boerhaave was a cultured man with broad interests. He was an accomplished musician; he republished many ancient, renaissance, and contemporary text; he spoke five languages and could read in seven. Nobility and royalty from many countries visited him, but he said the poor were his best patients, ‘for God paid for them.’ He turned down several tempting offers of professorships from several leading universities to continue teaching at Leyden. It was said he was so popular that church bells once signaled his recovery from gout” (Waife et al. 105).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/18053846,R128 .7 .B67 1708,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He spent some years in Rome, and, in 1635, became lecturer in mathematics at the University of Messina. He stayed there for twenty years, extending his interests into many fields. There was an epidemic of malarial fevers and Sicily in 1647 and 1648, the cause of which he was commissioned to investigate. He concluded that they were caused by the entrance of some chemical substance into the body with the food or not, as was generally believed, by influence of the weather or the stars. He then became interested in the chemical aspects of digestion.</p><p>“Later he served as a professor of mathematics at Pisa for ten years period this brought him into contact with many investigators, notably Malpighi. Although Borelli was still mainly interested in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he also studied the mechanics of physiology, investigating the kidney with his pupil Lorenzo Bellini and preparing this large volume on muscular activity. He returned to Messina in 1667 and there produced books on percussion and gravity, novel at the time but soon superseded by Newton's work. He fled Messina after involvement in a patriotic uprising against Spanish rule and spent his last years teaching at a boy’s school in Rome. Until his death in 1679, Borelli was also physician to the former Queen Christina of Sweden, in voluntary exile after her abdication. His great book on muscular motion was published posthumously.</p><p>“Borelli based his work on Harvey’s mathematical demonstration of the circulation of the blood, treating movements of the limbs and the internal organs and vessels in mechanical terms. However, he retained a hypothetical theory of ‘nervous juice,’ <i>succus nerveus</i>; this fluid, he thought, caused muscle contraction by coursing through the nerves and producing fermentation with the liquids in the muscles. He erroneously believed that the process increased the bulk of contracting muscle, a view already disproved by Steno and Glisson. In spite of this error in hypothesis, Borelli’s observations contributed to the understanding of body movements.</p><p>“His theory led him to explain the heartbeat as a simple muscular contraction activated by the nerves and to describe the circulation in simple hydraulic terms. He also contributed to the understanding of flight by calculating the mechanical relationship of the bird's wingbeat to the resistance of the air” (Waife et al. 91).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QP301 .B73 1680,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He was a self-taught scientist, philosopher, theologian, and writer. His medical degree was not actually earned but was awarded by the Royal Society in recognition of his achievements. His interests were chiefly in chemistry, and his name remains familiar in Boyle’s law on the relationship of temperature, pressure, and volume of gases. In 1656, he assisted Sir Christopher Wren in the first intravenous injection, an experiment in which they injected opium and crocus metallorum into the veins of dogs. The procedure was not generally adopted, however, because it often led to thrombosis and embolism. Published more than forty books or pamphlets and contributed nearly as many papers to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. In the field of biology, his experiments with flames and with animals <i>in vacuo</i> demonstrated that an unidentified element in the air was necessary for combustion as well as for life. A century later Lavoisier discovered the element to be oxygen.</p><p>“In this book on the blood, Boyle set forth a list of problems pertaining to whole blood, the serum, and the corpuscles. He then described his experiments and conclusions. He made a chemical analysis of human blood and discussed its affinity with the blood of ‘quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and sanguinous insects.’ Boyle easily obtained human blood for his experiments from barbers’ shops, where bloodletting was a daily practice.</p><p>“He announced a similar list of problems concerning urine, but the subject is not pursued further. Medically, this volume is the most important of Boyle's writings. It summarizes contemporary knowledge of the chemical content of the blood and is the first scientific study in physiologic chemistry.</p><p>“There's an interesting point about the printing of this book. It was first issued over the date 1684, but Boyle later reissued it with a new title page dated 1683/4 to establish its time of publication precisely. In accordance with the usage of the period, the commercial new year began on the March ‘quarter day,’ whereas the people’s New Year was observed on January 1; thus, the first quarter of the layman’s 1684 was the last quarter of the businessman’s 1863.</p> <p>“In his will, Boyle left part of his estate for the advancement of the Christian religion.

He also lectured on clinical medicine and therapeutics and enjoyed an illustrious reputation as artist, collector, Continental traveler, and writer as well as accomplished botanist and geologist.</p><p>“His <i>Reports of Medical Cases</i>, published in two volumes, was a series of case histories that correlated clinical and pathologic findings. The first volume included twenty-three cases of kidney disease. In his preface, Bright noted that the book contained ‘statements and conjectures regarding the dependence of a peculiar class of dropsies on disease and irritation of the kidneys.’ Besides his historic differentiation of renal from cardiac dropsy, Bright established the symptomatology of chronic nonsuppurative nephritis, the ‘Bright’s disease’ that has immortalized his name. Although he had observed his first postmortem case of chronic nephritis in 1811, he published no reports on this disease until 1827, after being convinced by long and patient study of many cases that his findings were scientifically supportable.</p><p>“The second volume was concerned mainly with diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including forty instances of cerebral hemorrhage. Bright presented cases of laryngeal tuberculosis, acne, and hydrocephalus, reported the relationship between chorea and rheumatism, and was the first to describe the administration of oxygen.</p><p>“The <i>Reports</i> is a notable landmark in publishing, both for its important new knowledge and for its beautifully expressive colored engravings. Bright himself was an artist, but for these plates he supervised the drawings done for him by Frederick Richard Say and the aquatint engravings made from them by the artist’s father, William Say.</p><p>“‘Utility is my object,’ Bright stated in his preface, ‘and the work which I now commence will not, in theory at least, be thoroughly completed until every disease which influences the natural structure, or originates in its derangements, has been connected with a corresponding organic lesion.’ He went a long way toward realizing this ambitious plan, with later reports in areas that comprise neurology, cardiac disease, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases. As he neared retirement, he was instrumental in the establishment of a forty-two-bed renal disease unit at Guy’s Hospital” (Waife et al. 183).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7330841,R114 .B7 v.1 - v.3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

When his memorable <i>Treatise</i> appeared, he had already published four medical books between 1580 and 1584. The <i>Treatise</i> was printed in 1586 by Thomas Vautrollier, a reputable but somewhat careless printer. Consequently, the book contained many misprints and was not registered as the law required. Bright transferred the book to John Windet, who produced a more correct edition in October of the same year and later printed other books for him.</p><p>“<i>A Treatise of Melancholie</i> was the first thorough study of a psychosomatic condition, for Bright recognized that this peculiar affliction was primarily an illness of the mind that, in turn, profoundly affected the health of the body. His approach, indicative of his dual professions, was both medical and religious. Shakespeare later drew on this book for his characterization of Hamlet, not only using the medical matter but also echoing Bright’s phrases in Hamlet’s speeches. Furthermore, the <i>Treatise</i> inspired Robert burton to write his large and more famous book on the same subject, <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i> (1621).</p><p>“Bright’s <i>Treatise</i> is closely printed on small pages and divided into forty-one chapters. The word ‘melancholie’ retained its first significance—a disease produced by an excess of ‘black bile’—but Bright’s treatment introduced the psychologic connotation it has since held. After debating whether it is congenital and therefore unpreventable ‘by fault of body,’  Bright describes how melancholy ‘worketh fearful passions in the mind,’ ‘how the body affecteth the soul,’ and how melancholy ‘procureth fear, sadness, despair,’ and he notices ‘how sickness and years alter the mind.’ He discusses the physical symptoms of melancholy—tears and sighing, weeping and laughing together, bashfulness, and the alteration of ‘natural actions.’ He differentiates melancholy from ‘the affliction of conscience for sin’ and shows that they can occur together.</p><p>“Treatment and cure occupy the last quarter of the book. Bright maintains that patients must ‘order themselves’ in mind, in sense and motion, in affections, and in choice of air, meat, and drink; their houses are to be kept cheerful and ‘lightsome,’ trim and neat; and their apparel should be light, clean, and well fitting. He prescribes suitable medicines and advises ‘the manner of strengthening melancholic persons after purging’” (Waife et al. 51).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7435743,RC618 .B7,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He had spent five years in Paris, where he made watercolor drawings of diseased tissues. In his illustrations, Carswell pursued a different purpose from that of a Parisian contemporary, Jean Cruveilhier, whose pathologic plates appeared in forty fascicles between 1828 and 1842. Cruveilhier’s work was an encyclopedia of case histories, fully described; Carswell’s book was a selection of representative renderings of diseased structures from some 2,000 drawings that he himself had made and copied onto lithographic stones for reproduction (The Lilly Library possesses two of his original drawings).</p><p>“Carswell was chiefly interested in etiology and the pathologic process in tissues. Some diseases he illustrated, such as disseminated sclerosis, had not yet been described clinically. He dealt with gross naked eye pathology at a time when the microscopic researches of Schwann, Purkinje, Bowman, and others were just beginning to lay the foundation for Virchow’s belief that pathology must be studied at the cellular level. Although it has been suggested that, without the microscope, Carswell did not properly understand complicated tissue, the accuracy and color of his illustrations have never been surpassed. This Atlas is notable for the merit of its artwork.</p><p>“The plate of osteomyelitis has been much admired, and among other markedly successful representations are those of bone sarcoma, cancer of the gallbladder, distension of the urethra, renal cysts, gastromalacia, bronchiectasis, and the scar tissue of burns. Each section of the Atlas has a lengthy introduction on the etiology, character, and progress of the general condition which the drawings illustrate. Carswell made frequent references to contemporary English and French work and discussed the opinions of earlier authorities. In the dedication to James Jeffray, he recalled that he ‘first attempted to represent by colored delineation the healthy and diseased appearances of the human body’ while attending Jeffray’s classes in Glasgow.</p><p>“Carswell proposed to publish the second edition with his illustrations of calculi, entozoa, and monstrosities, but this was not achieved. At the time he was holding his professorship, he also practiced as a physician in London. He was knighted by Queen Victoria and in 1840 moved to Brussels as physician to king Leopold of Belgium, an uncle of the queen” (Waife et al. 189).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RB33 .C32,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He might well have succeeded Fabricius to the chair of anatomy if his sudden death at the age of sixty-four had not preceded that of Fabricius by three years. Casserio was a keen comparative, as well as human anatomist and also a successful surgeon. His fame rests on his anatomic study of the organs of speech and hearing, <i>De Vocis Auditusque Organis Historia</i>, in which the orientation is clinical and, to a lesser degree, physiologic. The drawings for this work were based on his extensive human and animal dissections and were exceptionally well executed by Joseph Maurer, whose plates have been called ‘the model for the copperplate illustrator.’</p><p>“This volume is composed of two separate books that were issued together, although the second, on the subject of hearing, is dated a year earlier than the first. Each book is divided into three sections—fabric (anatomy), function (phonation or acoustics), and uses (physiology). The record many original observations and correct deductions, especially on the innervation of the parts described. Most valuable is the detailed account of the larynx, in which Casserio’s dissections of a wide range of animals—mammals, birds, amphibians, and even insects—are compared with his human material. He gives the first accurate description of the laryngeal muscles and nerves.</p><p>“Later he published a longer book on the organs of the five senses, <i>Pentaesthesion</i> (1609), illustrated with thirty-three plates. This work was considered authoritative until more detailed studies were made by anatomists of the later seventeenth century, some of whose ‘discoveries’ he anticipated. For instance, he described both the antrum named for Highmore (1651) and the conjunctival glands named for Meibom (1666). Seventy-eight plates that he had prepared for an atlas of general anatomy were published after his death. These splendid and accurate drawings were made by Fialetti, a pupil of Tintoretto. They include clear delineations of the abdominal muscles and viscera, the blood vessels of the liver, and the peritoneum. Many of these structures had never been illustrated before.</p><p>“Casserio was one of the representatives of the golden age of the school of anatomy at Padua” (Waife et al.  57).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7473560,QL853 .C3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In this volume, ‘Five Books of Peripatetic [i.e., Aristotelian] Questions’ (1571), he attempted a general survey of the medical and anatomic research of his contemporaries. Cesalpino had been a student at Padua under Matteo Realdo Colombo and may even have heard Vesalius lecture. He was only a few years younger than his teachers but long outlived them and practiced for many years in Rome.</p><p>“Aristotle's doctrines had been discussed in Italy since at least the thirteenth century, and Cesalpino tried to recapture Aristotle’s spirit of scientific inquiry, although he himself was a classifier rather than a discoverer. His best achievement as a naturalist was the introduction of a logical arrangement of plants based on their organs of fructification. This scheme of classification appeared in his <i>De Plantis, Libri XVI</i>, published in Florence in 1583. He then revised the ‘Peripatetic Questions,’ producing an expanded edition in 1593, and followed it with a more thorough medical textbook in two parts: ‘The Art of Medicine—Universal Diseases’ in 1602 and ‘The Hippocratic Mirror [Speculum] of the Art of Medicine’ in 1605. In that work, Cesalpino recorded observations he had made on the blood vessels; these to some extent anticipated William Harvey's exposition in 1628 of the circulation of the blood.</p><p>“For instance, in the <i>Quaestionum</i> he made the first published statement concerning the centripetal flow of blood in the veins. Elsewhere he describes ‘continuous motion from the veins to the heart and from the heart to the arteries.’ In another place, he says that the very hot blood from the heart passes through the lungs to be cooled by the air. From these scattered observations it is possible to build up a theory of the circulation, but Cesalpino did not make the necessary synthesis, nor did he provide any experimental evidence to support his theory of blood circulation. It has been noticed that Harvey, who acknowledged indebtedness to hints from Colombo, Fabricius, and others, never once mentioned Cesalpino as a forerunner” (Waife et al. 45).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8591248,QM178 .C4,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Before his death at the age of sixty-eight, he had transformed La Salpêtrière from a women’s prison—an asylum for the aged, infirm, and insane—into the greatest neurologic clinic of modern times.</p><p>“Although he is remembered primarily for his contributions to neurology, Charcot’s first areas of interest were rheumatism, gout, and the diseases of the elderly. At the age of twenty-eight, he completed his doctoral thesis on the differential symptoms and lesions of gout and arthritis. His first professional post at La Salpêtrière was in pathologic anatomy; in 1882, when the department of neurology was created, he became its first professor and chairman and remained in that position until his death eleven years later.</p><p>“In 1876, Charcot published his work on the localization of functions in cerebral and spinal disease. The book is clinically oriented and deals with such topics as hemiplegia and spinal lesions. Cerebral disorders are discussed in the first part and spinal disorders in the second. Small black-and-white illustrations clarify the text.</p><p>“Charcot’s far-reaching interests and contributions are commemorated in the wide range of clinical entities that bear his name. Among these are the Charcot triad (intention tremor, nystagmus, and staccato speech) that occurs in multiple sclerosis; Charcot’s joint, a neuropathic arthropathy seen in diabetic polyneuritis, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis, in which articular cartilage and subjacent bone degenerate and result in joint instability; and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or peroneal muscular atrophy.</p><p>“Charcot brought order into the classification of nervous diseases and was a pioneer in psychotherapy. Freud worked with him for a few months in 1885 and later translated Charcot’s lectures into German. Charcot defined hysteria as ‘a condition induced by purely mental processes;’ it depended, he said, on the subject’s susceptibility to suggestion and did not arise from organic lesions in the central nervous system.</p><p>“Not only was Charcot a superb teacher who could mimic tics, spasms, rigidity, and other symptoms for his students, but his skill as a clinician was recognized internationally. He described multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabetic arthropathies, and spastic paralysis. Other areas of interest included exophthalmic goiter and intermittent claudication” (Waife et al. 229).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Charcot, Jean Martin, <i>Les centres moteurs corticaux chez l'homme</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15713652 ; <i>Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière : service de M.

He had traveled as a young man in northern Italy and studied under Morgagni at Padua; in middle age he visited Austria and Germany in attendance on his king. During the first half of his life, he was active in research on anatomy and its bearing on physiologic problems. He was also a scholarly connoisseur of books and amassed a fine library.</p><p>“At the age of twenty-five, he followed Valsalva’s discovery of aural structure with a study of the fluids of the inner ear, <i>De Aquaeductibus Auris Humanae Internae</i> (Naples, 1761), in which he described the parts of the inner ear, established the existence of the labyrinthine fluid, and offered a theory of resonance to explain the process of hearing. He is also known for his careful account of the pathologic findings in the intestines of persons who had died of typhoid fever and for his demonstration that albuminuria can be detected by boiling the urine.</p><p>“<i>De Ischiade Nervosa Commentarius</i>, in fifty-seven chapters, was published when he was twenty-eight. It differentiated between two kinds of ‘sciatica,’ neurologic and arthritic, by showing that the sciatic nerve is involved with the former. Cotugno covered in great detail the symptoms and etiology of sciatica and also outlined his method of treating it. In the course of this account, he gave the first extensive description of the cerebrospinal fluid, which had been mentioned by Valsalva (q.v.) in 1692. Cotugno revised the book for three subsequent editions, and it was also translated into English (1785) and German (1792).</p><p>“Cotugno anticipated Richard Bright by more than fifty years in his description of nephrosis, wrote a useful book on smallpox (1769), and advocated the public control of tuberculosis.

He was lecturer on the anatomy of the muscles to the Company of Surgeons in London, a position he held for the last fourteen years of his life. His most notable contributions to medicine were his monographs on muscle physiology and on the embryology of the chick, both of which were published after the essay on muscular movement.</p><p>“The treatise on muscular motion was an attempt to give a rational account of muscle contraction. Accepting the then-current belief that the action of the nerves was affected by ‘nervous spirit,’ he suggested that this fluid was a ‘spiritous liquor,’ a rectified and ‘enriched juice,’ which interacted with the blood and other substances in the muscle to produce contraction. Yet he hinted that the nerve impulse consisted of vibrations along the nerve that was in a state of tension.</p><p>“The year after the publication of his essay, Croone met Nicolaus Steno and learned of a new—and still unpublished—discovery: that muscles do not enlarge when in contraction. In spite of this new knowledge, Croone proceeded to develop his theory of contraction, suggesting that each individual muscle fiber contained small bladders to receive the increased fluids supplied from the nerves. The series of lectures in which this refined theory was presented was delivered in 1674-1675 but was not published until 1681. Before the lectures appeared in book form, Francis Glisson stated, in 1677, that muscle does not increase in volume when it contracts. Glisson’s conclusion, made with the authority of long experience, overshadowed Croone’s theory even in his lifetime. Croone is perhaps best remembered from the famous Croonian Lectures; these were endowed by his widow from the fortune that she inherited at his death in 1684” (Waife et al. 75).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7433454,QP301 .C948,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Organs were compared to machines, biologic functions to mechanical processes. Descartes’s interpretations of his observations were speculative; he set out from what he knew to find the cause of what he saw. Although he performed a wide range of animal dissections and chemical manipulations, he never fully grasped the scientific method of hypothesis tested by experiment. Nevertheless, most of the experimentalists who made such great advances in knowledge late in the 17th century were deeply influenced by his mechanistic approach, which allowed them to discard traditional conceptual explanations.</p><p>“These two treatises were published posthumously. ‘On Man’ (<i>De Homine</i>) was translated from the French manuscript into Latin by Schuyl, who took some liberties with the text and the illustrations. The French edition two years later was an accurate representation of Descartes’s original manuscript and artwork and included his essay on the fetus.</p><p>“The volume on man considers the Organism as an automaton and discusses ‘the machine of the body’ and ‘how the machine moves.’ The workings of the interior and the external senses, particularly vision, are explained. The book ends with a discourse on ‘animal spirits’ and the function of brain and nerves.</p><p>“The treatise on the formation of the fetus is more speculative and dogmatic. It is based on a conceptual picture of the corpuscles of the male and female seeds fermenting together to create the heart and lungs, the blood, sense organs, and nerves; later these coalesce to make the tissues that grow together to form the solid parts.</p><p>“From his mother, Descartes is said to have inherited both weak lungs and enough property to free him for philosophic pursuits. He learned mathematics and physics from Jesuit teachers, whose school he entered at the age of ten. After finishing his formal education (he graduated in law at the age of twenty), he lived in Holland and Germany, traveled in Italy, and sought intellectual stimulation among the natural scientists and philosophers of Paris. Some of his interests in physics and mathematics come to us in such expressions as Cartesian geometry, Cartesian coordinates, and Cartesian diver.</p><p>“He lived in Holland from 1628 to 1649 and then moved to Sweden in Queen Christina’s invitation. The harsh weather of Stockholm was too severe for his weak lungs, and he died at the age of fifty-three, a great philosopher, mathematician, and scientist” (Waife et al. 81).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7977218,QP29 .D43,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Dioscorides described more than six hundred plants and plant principles encountered during his army service in the lands around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The compendium, written in Greek, noted the plants’ botanic characteristics and their real or traditional medical properties. Almost one hundred of these plants still serve a pharmaceutical purpose today.</p><p>“Although opium had been in use for centuries, Dioscorides was the first to write about its virtues, to point out its great benefits in the relief of pain, insomnia, and chronic cough, and to note its dangerous effects, particularly those of overdose. He was also the first to describe the medicinal usefulness of aloes, ammoniac, aconite, and ginger. He invented the name ‘<i>hydrargyrum</i>’ (liquid silver) for mercury; he recommended iron for uterine hemorrhage and aspidium for tapeworm infestation; and he was the first to state the need for testing the purity of drugs. Among the methods he advised for detecting adulteration were drug solubility, specific gravity, and reaction to ignition.</p><p>“Dioscorides also dealt with animal and mineral products useful in medicine and discussed diet and wines. He suggested mandragora wine for insomnia and pain and specifically for analgesia during surgery. An astute observer, Dioscorides recognized family relationships between plants seventeen centuries before Linnaeus.</p><p>“By the sixth century, the poorly organized compendium had been rearranged alphabetically, illustrations of plants had been added, and a Latin translation had been made. The book was translated during the following centuries into most of the languages of the modern and ancient world, including Arabic in the ninth century. The first printed edition, a Latin version, appeared in Italy in 1478, and the original Greek text was published in Venice in 1499. The revival of the teachings of Dioscorides during the Renaissance laid the foundations for scientific botany and pharmacy. Unfortunately, because all plants were thought to be universally distributed, a great deal of time and ingenuity were wasted in trying to equate western flora with the plants described by Dioscorides” (Waife et al. 21).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Dioscorides, <i>Pedakiou Dioskoridou tou Anazarbeōs ta Sōzomena hapanta . . .</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1414291) ; Mattioli, Pietro Andrea, <i>Les commentaires de M.P.

As a result, when the Latin version finally appeared in 1545, it was overshadowed by Vesalius’s masterpiece, <i>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</i>, which had been issued two years earlier. Vesalius may well have seen Estienne’s drawings while he was working in Paris from 1533 to 1536 and may have been inspired to improve upon them. Certainly Estienne’s plates, the earliest of which was dated 1530, are lower in quality (especially the skeletons) than those in Vesalius’s book.</p><p>“Charles Estienne (1504-1564), who belonged to a famous family of scholar-printers, began his career as a student of natural history. He turned to anatomy through his association with a surgeon, Estienne de la Rivière, and finally qualified in medicine in 1540. By that time, the text of this book had been virtually completed. Publication was then delayed, however, because La Rivière sought an injunction from the Paris courts to compel Charles Estienne to display his name on the title page as co-author. The case dragged on for several years before La Rivière achieved his purpose.</p><p>“Although the book was surpassed by Vesalius’s <i>Fabrica</i>, it was not a failure. This French translation appeared a year after the original Latin version, and both editions, it has been said, are ‘exciting spectacles, even in the shadow of Vesalius.’ The text and the illustrations, moreover, reflect what was known and taught in Paris, site of the most influential medical school in northern Europe at that time.</p><p>“The illustrations are of considerable artistic interest, for the authors adapted existing art forms to display their new understanding of anatomy. The first ‘book’ includes fifteen full-page, full-length plates of human figures, depicting skeletons, muscles, and the systems of veins and nerves. Nerves, for instance, hang ‘in ribbons’ around the skeleton. The second section, which describes the male viscera, contains illustrations based on baroque designs with the figures in dramatic poses. In the third book, the plates showing female organs present nudes with the viscera viewed somewhat ludicrously through a window in the abdomen.</p><p>“Estienne did not reshape anatomic thought as Vesalius did; he presented only what his eyes showed him. His text records many original observations, especially on the bones, nerves, and veins and on the technique of dissection” (Waife et al. 33).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7474267,QM21 .E81 1546,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Although the plates that illustrated his distinctly original observations were engraved by 1552, they remained unprinted for 160 years. Early in the eighteenth century, they were found in the Vatican Library and presented by Pope Clement XI to his physician, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, who in 1714 published the forty-seven plates with his own notes.</p><p>“Whereas Vesalius designed his illustrations to exhibit nature as he had observed it (however artistically the figures were posed), Eustachius drew anatomic types based on study of many different cadavers. Although he, too, arranged his figures in lifelike poses, he was more interested in accurate proportions. This is emphasized by the frame and scale of measurement around each plate. Thus, the whole picture is both representational and mathematically exact. Vesalius’s artist had employed wood engraving with its strong contrast, but Eustachius preferred the newer copper engraving, which permitted a more delicate delineation of detail. By juxtaposition of drawings, he also contrived to show front-and-back and left-and-right views of the same figure. Among the best plates are those displaying the base of the brain and the sympathetic nervous system, the relationships of blood vessels and muscles, and the structure of the larynx. Many of the illustrations present the component parts of a particular system; each part is identified by a Roman numeral that corresponds to a discussion in the text.</p><p>“Eustachius himself had published an important small volume, <i>Opuscula Anatomica</i> (‘Little Works on Anatomy’), which contained chapters on the kidneys, the organs of hearing, the bones, the motions of the head, the azygos vein, and the common deep vein of the arm. A companion treatise on the teeth gave the first accurate account of their structure. Eustachius’s essay on the veins shows advanced knowledge of the heart structure. The eustacian tube, named for him, was first described in the section on the organs of hearing. The treatise on the kidney is his best work and is illustrated by eight excellent small plates which, like his large anatomy plates, were designed with a graduated border. Among his other original observations is the first account of the adrenals” (Waife et al. 41).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QM21 .E9,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He was also a successful practicing surgeon. His work on veins undoubtedly inspired his pupil William Harvey to study the functioning of the cardiovascular system, although Fabricius himself did not draw far-reaching physiologic conclusions from his own anatomic observations of the circulation.</p><p>“The presence of valves in the veins had been known for at least the middle of the sixteenth century, but Fabricius gave the first complete description of them in his brief essay. Printed in very large format, the book’s twenty-three pages include eight full-page illustrations. The second occupies a two-page spread and shows the veins at the inner surface of the arm, which is stretched out as if for bloodletting. Harvey adapted this plate in reduced size for the illustrations in his epoch-making treatise published in 1628, in which he announced and expounded his discovery of the circulation of the blood.</p><p>“Although he was an indefatigable worker whose accurately recorded observations give him high rank as a medical biologist, Fabricius was a traditionalist. He dissected a great variety of animals and birds without comparing their homologies. He postulated a local, almost entirely structural, purpose for the organs he dissected and did not extend his opinions to wider physiologic horizons as did Harvey and the later seventeenth-century anatomists. The term he used for the valves, <i>’ostiola’</i>, implies small sluice gates in a stream, and he thought of them as serving to slow down the blood flow and maintain an even distribution of blood to the parts of the body.</p><p>“Fabricius intended to prepare a survey of the whole animal ‘fabric,’ to repeat Vesalius’s term. Toward this he gathered colored illustrations of comparative anatomic subjects, which still remain on view in Venice. He published instead a series of special studies between 1600 and 1618 on anatomic and physiologic subjects and on Embryology. This book is the fourth of ten such monographs.</p><p>“It is significant that there is a direct teacher-student line from Vesalius to Fallopius to Fabricius to Harvey” (Waife et al. 59).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8591295,QM191 .F3 1603,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The year before his death, he published this one book, <i>Observationes Anatomicae</i>. The small, thick volume is mainly a commentary on some points made by Vesalius in the <i>Fabrica</i> rather than a formal treatise. However, it did present many new discoveries and thus displayed Falloppio’s  independent achievement. In form, it is a long, continuous narrative without summary, index, or illustrations. (The text includes a tabular classification of the different kinds of joints.)</p><p>“Although a great admirer of Vesalius, whom he called ‘divine’—or, as we might say, ‘inspired’—Falloppio did not hesitate to point out where his own dissections had shown the master to be wrong. He sent a copy of his book to the famous anatomist, then at the Spanish court, where he had gone as physician to Emperor Charles V, and Vesalius wrote a courteous reply dated December 17, 1561. Vesalius, who was then still under fifty, hoped to return to research again at Padua. Falloppio then died of tuberculosis before receiving Vesalius’ answer, and Vesalius died on the Greek island of Zante in the Ionian Sea in 1564 on his way home from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The text of his answer to Falloppio was published by friends later that year.</p><p>“Falloppio’s most original contribution was made in his dissections and discussions of the female reproductive organs. He first clearly differentiated and named several special structures and, in particular, described the oviducts named for him. He himself employed the Latin term <i>tuba</i>, a trumpet, to indicate their trumpet-shaped lateral extremities.</p><p>“Falloppio added to knowledge of the centers of ossification and described the primary teeth and their replacement. He improved on earlier accounts of the muscles of the head and face and also made numerous discoveries concerning nerve pathways. He was the first anatomist to delineate precisely all three ossicles of the ear, and he provided a full description of the kidney” (Waife et al. 39).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Vesalius, Andreas et al., <i>Opera omnia anatomica et chirurgica</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15712493",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15713621,QM421 .F2,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Research by Flourens in the 1820’s had suggested that such localization was general, not specific. During the 1860’s, the problem was explored in England, France, and Germany. The discoveries made there were extensively corroborated by David Ferrierr in the 1870’s, before he made his own contribution to our knowledge of the central-nervous-system functions.</p><p>“Born in Scotland, Ferrier (1843-1928) became professor of forensic medicine at King’s College, London. In 1873, while working at the West Riding Lunatic Asylum in Yorkshire, he combined clinical observation of nervous diseases with experimental research on any species of animals, utilizing electrical stimulation of the brain cortex. He summarized his work in the Croonian lectures before the Royal Society in 1874. These lectures were ultimately published in his book, which he characterized as ‘a systematic exposition of the bearing of my own experiments.’</p><p>“The volume consists of thirteen chapters. Ferrier sketched the structure of the brain and then described the functions he had located in its various parts. He discussed the phenomena of electrical irritation, the physiologic and psychologic aspects of the brain hemispheres (including the problem of mind, with aphasia and inhibition), and then the functions of the basal ganglia. He concluded with a diagrammatic survey of cerebral and cranial topography and, from his clinical and pathologic discoveries, noted the homologies between his observations in man and his experimental findings in animals.</p><p>“His Gulstonian lectures on <i>The Localization of Cerebral Disease</i> (1878) provided the clinical and pathologic complement to Ferrier’s mainly experimental work, and in 1889 he was appointed to a professorship of neuropathology at King’s College. Ultimately, he received a knighthood for his contributions to neurology, which have come to be regarded as the foundation upon which all of our present knowledge concerning the localization of cerebral functions has been built” (Waife et al. 231).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QP385 .F39,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In the sixteenth century, men like him who operated for stones or repaired hernias were usually itinerant surgeons, often regarded with some doubt by the apothecaries and physicians, who considered them mercenaries. Franco, however, apart from an interval spent in Switzerland as a Huguenot refugee at the time of the Waldensian massacres, spent most of his life in Orange, where he established himself as a respected professional. His books also helped greatly to elevate the status of the humble practitioners who performed lithotomy and were forerunners of the modern surgeon.</p><p>“In 1556, Franco published a ‘Little Treatise on Surgery Such as the Hernia Surgeons Perform.’ It was followed five years later by this more complete and useful small, thick book. Although the treatise on hernias is dedicated to Jacques Roy, ‘Lieutenant of the Master-Surgeons of Lyons,’ it also contains a nine-year copyright privilege from the king of France and a license to print from the provost of the Sworn Surgeons of Paris. These legal authorizations suggest that Franco wished to make his book known not only in the south, where he lived, but all over France.</p><p>“Written in the vernacular, the book provides the first practical and precise account of the surgery of hernias, stones in the bladder, and cataracts. It is well illustrated with full-page woodcuts, including clear diagrams of instruments and three drawings of skeletons copied from Vesalius but reduced in size. Franco was the first surgeon to record operative cure of a strangulated hernia and the first to perform suprapubic cystotomy.

He was a founder and the first president of the Pennsylvania Hospital, of which he wrote a history. He invented the bifocal lens and a flexible catheter and wrote on the use of electricity for the treatment of paralysis. This treatment was named for him (franklinization). He also studied and wrote about lead poisoning, night blindness, sleep, the ‘heat’ of blood, the infectious nature of colds, infection from cadavers, the infant death rate, and medical education. His <i>Dialogue with Gout</i> (1759) is of special interest because he himself suffered from this disease.</p><p>“Public health was one of Franklin's many interests, but at first he opposed smallpox inoculation, which at the time was indeed dangerous. Later, when his youngest son died of the disease, he regretted his opposition and became an advocate. Variolation, the practice of inoculating humans with dried, unmodified matter to prevent contagious smallpox, had been introduced into Western Europe from Turkey about 1720. In England it was strongly advocated by Dr. Richard Mead, the leading London physician. However, it was not until the 1750’s, when severe epidemics of smallpox recurred, that variolation became general. While he was in England between 1757 and 1762 as agent for the Pennsylvania Assembly, Franklin gathered statistics from both English and American sources to present a strong argument in favor of variolation. He published these in his pamphlet, together with ‘Plain Instructions’ for inoculation. The latter were written at his request by a London physician who has been variously identified as Edward Archer or William Heberden. The page of Franklin's text reproduced [in Waife et al.] reminds us that the present-day problems of designing and evaluating clinical investigations are nothing new.</p><p>“Improved methods of variolation were introduced in the 1760’s, but the preliminary treatment was severe, the results were unpredictable, and a permanent reservoir of smallpox carriers was created. Search for a safer preventative measure therefore went on; the search culminated in Jenner’s vaccination, announced in 1798.</p><p>“The short pamphlet in the Lilly Library is an important contribution to the movement that finally led to eradication of this dread disease” (Waife et al. 123).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7434946,RC183 .F8,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

After graduating in medicine and working for some years at the General Hospital in Vienna, Freud (1856-1939) obtained a traveling scholarship that enabled him to visit Paris and study at the clinic of Charcot, the eminent French neurologist. On returning home in 1885, Freud became lecturer in neuropathology at the university and began his private practice in neurology, a specialty that then included psychiatry.</p><p>“Freud had been impressed by Charcot’s theory that hysteria was a thought disturbance rather than a disease of the nervous system and also was greatly influenced by his senior colleague, Josef Breuer, who had some success in relieving the symptoms of hysteria with hypnosis. These experiences stimulated Freud's interest in the subconscious mind and led to his method of ‘psychoanalysis,’ in which, by ‘free association,’ his patients unburden themselves of their repressed emotions and almost-forgotten thoughts. He made this discovery public in ‘Studies on Hysteria,’ written with Breuer in 1893, and explained his method in ‘Interpretation of Dreams’ (1900).</p><p>“Freud built a theory about neurotic behavior and its origin in repressed erotic urges. To him, these were not necessarily physical and included normal love for parents, spouse, children, friends, and self. This new book of 1904, incorporating his ideas in an analysis of mistakes of speech he had observed in himself and in his friends and patients, led to the ‘Theory of Sexuality’ (1905), in which his chief conclusions were finally elaborated. Freud’s doctrines affected a liberalization of general attitudes toward mental and sexual abnormality, but his rejection of criticism and his intolerant insistence that he alone was right lessened his influence on medical psychology.</p><p>“The easy narrative style of ‘Psychopathology’ made it acceptable to a wide public. After writing about the almost universal forgetfulness of proper names, Freud went on to discuss other forms of verbal error such as substitution of words and speech, reading, and writing, and, through careful retracing of unconscious thought processes, related them to hidden memories or fears. He dealt similarly with mistaken impressions, neglected resolutions, and ‘unconscious’ acts and ended with a general chapter on determinism and on actions apparently influenced by chance or superstition” (Waife et al. 249).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,BF173 .F8,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

It was then common practice to aid removal of bullets by promoting suppuration, but von Gersdorff recommended probing for them with special instruments and then pouring hot oil into the wound.

The research was done twelve or more years before the book was published. Glisson recorded that he discovered the ‘common capsule,’ now named for him, while preparing a lecture in 1642. This ‘capsule of Glisson’ is the envelope of fibrous tissue that encloses the portal vein and hepatic artery (the two vessels carrying blood to the liver) and becomes continuous with the fibrous scaffolding of the whole organ.</p><p>“Glisson made use of injection and casts and included a good engraving of a cast of the liver vessels. He also reported in detail his experiment to show the passage of the blood from the portal vein to the vena cava and demonstrated that the color of the liver derives from the contained blood. In the final chapters, he proved that the lymph flows, not to the liver, as had been taught, but from it and passes to the then recently discovered ‘common receptacle.’</p><p>“Four years earlier, Glisson had published the first clear description of infantile rickets, which was called ‘Glisson’s disease.’ Many years later, in his book on the stomach and intestines (1677), he demonstrated the mechanism of muscle contraction, substituting the theory of inherent ‘irritability’ for the prevalent idea of ‘vital spirits’” (Waife et al. 67).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QP185 .G6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

When summoned to Paris at the age of thirty-four by Francis I, king of France, who wished to spread the ‘new learning’ of the Italian Renaissance throughout his kingdom, Guidi brought with him a copy of an ancient Greek surgical manuscript as a gift for the king. Guidi’s medical and artistic background enabled him to appreciate the importance of this classical book with its illustrations of the manipulative operations devised by the Greek surgeons. Francis I appointed Guidi to organize the medical teaching in his new Collège de France, and under his patronage Guidi published his own Latin translation and commentary on the ancient Greek text, with the figures redrawn by skilled Italian artists.</p><p>“His book is a splendid oversize volume that has been called ‘the most beautiful textbook of surgery printed in the sixteenth century’ with ‘woodcut illustrations [that] have never been equaled in this field.’ The full title, which may be translated as ‘Surgery Turned from Greek into Latin by Guido Guidi of Florence, Translator, with Some Commentaries by the Same Guidi,’ conceals the fact that the book provided contemporary Europeans with the best surgical treatises of the whole classical period. The text begins with the writings of Hippocrates on ulcers, fistulas, and wounds of the head and continues with Galen’s commentary on Hippocrates on fractures and joints. The large, clear woodcuts reconstruct ancient apparatus, showing a surgeon and his assistants reducing a dislocated shoulder, straightening a curved vertebral column on a special bed, and many similar procedures. These drawings were promptly copied by Ambroise Paré, the greatest surgeon of these decades, and often recopied. The book also contains Hippocratic views on the duties of a physician; Galen’s on bandaging, as illustrated by more than one hundred small figures; and those of Oribasius on ligatures and mechanical aids to surgery, with more large woodcuts.</p><p>“In dedication to Francis I, Guidi wrote: ‘Our surgeons cannot bandage properly, or fix suitable appliances to align broken bones, or treat wounds of the head adequately, because they lack the Greek authors who excelled in developing this part of medicine.’ Guidi returned to Italy, where he became professor of anatomy at Pisa, but the results of his research were published only in part and long after his death. The Latin form of his name, Vidus Vidius, is commemorated in the Vidian canal of the sphenoid bone, but the true monument to his influence is his book on surgery with its excellent illustrations” Guidi, Guido (Waife et al. 31).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7330695,R126.A1 G9,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

During a period of brooding and study, he wondered why quinine cured the paroxysms of malaria. Upon taking the drug, he was promptly seized by a reaction similar to that of malaria patients;  after his wife and five children also reacted this way, he decided that quinine cured malaria by producing counterfeit disease. He evolved the concept of <i>similia similibus curantur</i> (like should be cured by like) after several years of experimentation. According to this principle, a patient should be given a specific drug that would reproduce in a healthy individual the symptoms, or the clinical picture, of the disease under treatment. Hahnemann Introduce the new system publicly in 1796. His method stressed careful history-taking and the use of very small doses of single drugs in preference to overdosage with many. In the context of the practice of the day, it was a welcome improvement in therapeutics.</p><p>“His most important book, on ‘rational treatment’ (1810), had a considerable impact on medical practice. It naturally aroused the enmity of the apothecaries, who forced him to leave Leipzig in 1821.</p><p>“He became rich and famous in time and, at the age of seventy-nine, married a wealthy woman who was forty-five years his junior. The couple moved to Paris, where Hahnemann developed a highly successful practice among the aristocracy. He continued to work until his death at the age of eighty-eight.</p><p>“The concept of homeopathy spread rapidly in Europe and in the United States, where medical schools were established to teach this system. However, the introduction of pure chemicals and controlled animal experiments led to the establishment of more rational therapeutics and the rise of modern pharmacology” (Waife et al. 163).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7430552,RX68 .O68,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The second edition (1751) is one hundred pages longer than the first, but the same arrangement of the contents was kept. Von Haller’s style is clear and lively.

According to the ancient biographers, his father, a teacher of medicine, provided him with his first training in the healing arts. Later, Hippocrates studied in Athens and then gained wide experience from practicing in cities throughout Macedonia, Thessaly, and Thrace. The writings attributed to him (though undoubtedly composed by many authors over a long period of time) were assembled two hundred years after his death.</p><p>“Long before the day of Hippocrates, followers of Aesculapius (mortal, god, and myth all in one) had taken the practice of medicine into the temples. Disease and its cure were associated with the wrath of the gods, divine miracles, and the interpretation and control of dreams. Hippocrates taught that disease is a physical disturbance attributable to or resulting in disorders in the bodily fluids. To detect these changes, Hippocrates and his followers recommended a careful history and a complete physical examination, with study of the patient by all the physician’s senses.</p><p>“Although Hippocrates paid homage to the past (the Hippocratic oath invokes Apollo, Aesculapius, Panacea, and ‘all the gods and goddesses’), it is to him that medicine owes the beginning of clinical observation and rational study of the body.</p><p>“Whereas other physicians concealed their errors, Hippocrates advocated learning from one’s mistakes by frankly examining them and seeking their causes. His honesty, high ideals, and deep respect for his patients set Hippocrates apart from all earlier physicians. He has rightly come to be regarded as the ‘Father of Medicine,’ largely because he established the first rational school of medicine.</p><p>“The ‘Aphorisms’ are best known of the Hippocratic writings. The first aphorism has become a universal proverb: <i>Vita brevis: ars longo: occasio praeceps: experimentum fallax: iudicium difficile est</i> (life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experiment dangerous, decision difficult). The rest of the aphorisms are more technical and record precise clinical observations only occasionally modified by traditional beliefs.</p><p>“In this book published in Florence in 1494, the aphorisms have accompanying notes by the translator Lorenzo Lorenzini, and then follows Galen’s commentary, similarly translated from Greek into Latin. The handsome volume in beautiful Florentine type, now a treasured rarity, thus includes the two most famous names in Greco-Roman medicine: Hippocrates, the earliest truly scientific physician, and Galen, the Greek from Pergamum, who practiced in Rome around A.D. 160 to 190, nearly six centuries after Hippocrates. Galen was considered the absolute master of medical knowledge for fifteen hundred years” (Waife et al. 13).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/6263388,R126.H6 A65 1494,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The basic teaching was described in his small book written for these students as well as for mothers and untrained children’s nurses. In it he discusses the differing nutritional needs of the newborn and older infants; the methods whereby cow’s milk should be pasteurized and modified to simulate human milk in its concentrations of carbohydrate, protein, and fat; and ways in which cereals and other foods should be introduced with and later given as substitutes for milk.

John showed such a striking aptitude for the new activity that, within a year, he was demonstrating the art of dissection. Although he never had a traditional medical education, he began to study surgery at the age of twenty-three under William Cheselden.</p><p>“John Hunter's superb background in comparative anatomy and pathology and his ability to relate structure to function made him one of England’s greatest surgeons and perhaps the founder of experimental surgery. Among his innovations was a technique for treating aneurysms without amputation by use of a single ligature to tie off the artery in the healthy tissue. He is said to have elevated surgery from an art to a science by showing that the proper route to the operating room led through the laboratory.</p><p>“In a busy life devoted to research, teaching, and the practice of surgery, Hunter found time to study the structure, development, and diseases of the teeth and to collect and arrange a series of dental specimens. Hunter’s two treatises on the teeth rank him as one of the founders of modern scientific dentistry.</p><p>“In the first book (1771), Hunter classified the teeth in the system still used today and was the first to state definitely that the human teeth ‘are never more than thirty-two.’ He traced their development in the fetus and the child and established the structure of pulp, bone, and enamel. At the end of the book are descriptions of devices to correct malocclusion and even suggestions for a method of transplantation.</p><p>“The second volume (1778) dealt with pathology. Plus the diseases of the teeth, the alveolar processes, and the gums; abscesses; and nerve pains in the jaws. He concluded that tooth decay starts on the surface of the tooth and not in the interior.</p><p>“Like his brother William, John founded a famous museum. Housing more than 13,000 specimens demonstrating comparative anatomy and the physiologic processes in animals and man, it was also a menagerie that contained numerous live mammals. After his death, the great Hunterian Museum became the property of the Royal College of Surgeons. It was partially destroyed by Nazi bombs in 1941.</p><p>“John Hunter was a student of Percivall Pott, a teacher of Edward Jenner, and with William Heberden, a consultant on an illness of Benjamin Franklin. Originally buried in St. Martins-in-the-Fields, his body was moved to Westminster Abbey sixty-six years after his death” (Waife et al. 131).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RK50 .H94,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Hunter was an inspired teacher; his school of anatomy attracted men who became famous anatomists and surgeons. Among the latter was his brother John, who was ten years his junior. William Hunter’s home housed not only the school of anatomy but also a museum for his collections—books and manuscripts, paintings, coins, medals, and anatomic and pathologic specimens. These collections were later bequeathed to the University of Glasgow, where Hunter had studied for five years.</p><p>“Hunter spent almost twenty-five years preparing <i>The Anatomy of the Gravid Human Uterus</i>, the most magnificent obstetric atlas ever published. He engaged the best artists to draw and engrave the thirty-four illustrations, and it was printed by John Baskerville, the finest printer of the age, at the peak of his career. The life-size line engravings, many measuring 54 by 56 centimeters, achieve effects of depth and contrast without losing sharpness of detail and present a wide range of normal and pathologic conditions of the womb and fetus. Each page of text is printed in two columns, one in Latin and the other in English.</p><p>“William and his brother John explored the anatomy of the placenta and described the separate circulatory systems of the mother and the fetus. The brothers later quarreled over who should receive recognition for this work and separated professionally about three years before William’s death.</p><p>“William Hunter was the first to describe retroversion of the uterus (1770). Outside the field of obstetrics, he is remembered for the first description of arteriovenous aneurysm and for clarifying the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatics. He was professor of anatomy in the Royal Academy and a Fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian societies.</p><p>“Hunter never married. A hardworking, disciplined man who lived simply and frugally, he was troubled by severe attacks of gout, a disease that also affected other members of his family.

Probably the first to employ the microscope in the investigation of disease was the Jesuit priest of Fulda, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), contemporary with but slightly older than van Leeuwenhoek. This learned man was a virtuoso musician, orientalist, mathematician, and physicist and had some knowledge of medicine. His study of plague is valuable for its well-understood and carefully explained theory of <i>contagium vivum</i> or the infection by living matter. In his <i>Scrutinium</i>, published in Rome in 1658, he describes his studies on putrefaction, during which he saw maggots and other creatures develop in necrotic tissue. He found the blood of plague patients full of ‘little worms which propagate plague, so very small and unperceivable except with a very fine microscope.’</p><p>“This description occurs in the central section of his book, where he dealt with the ‘contagion or kindling of plague’ at some length.

Matthew Baillie, the leading British physician of the time, wrote to him that his book was ‘the fullest and most able account of the diseased appearances of the Heart and Lungs which has yet been published.’ It enjoyed immediate international success, and in 1826, the year of his death, Laënnec brought out an expanded edition, giving more attention to pathology and treatment.</p><p>“Auscultatory percussion, the evocation of sounds within the chest by tapping with the fingers, had been introduced by Auenbrugger nearly fifty years earlier but spread only slowly into practice until 1806, when Corvisart, Laënnec’s teacher, began to advocate its use. Laënnec’s innovation was the stethoscope, an instrument for ‘indirect auscultation’ through amplification of the chest sounds.</p><p>“In its four parts, the book deals with exploration of the voice and the diagnosis of phthisis; study of the respiratory organs, pneumonia, emphysema, pleurisy, and pneumothorax; the bronchial sounds; and investigation of the circulation, including analysis of the heart sounds, diseases of the heart, and aneurysm of the aorta. The illustrations on four double plates show Laënnec’s newly invented stethoscope, pathologic conditions of the lung, and deformity of the chest from chronic latent pleurisy.</p><p>“Laënnec also wrote numerous works on other medical subjects, including treatises on peritonitis, the capsule of the liver, and pathologic anatomy, especially that type of liver cirrhosis which has been named for him. He added significantly to the knowledge of pathology with his method of correlating clinical observations with postmortem findings.</p><p>“His abiding interest, however, was the diagnosis of diseases of the chest, a preoccupation quite possibly attributable to the fact that his mother had died of tuberculosis when he was a very small child. This heritage, along with a frail constitution and close association with pulmonary disease patients, led, ironically, to his own death from tuberculosis at the age of forty-five” (Waife et al. 173).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7431937,RC76.3 .L28 v.1 - v.2,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He was remarkable for the range of his research in comparative anatomy, embryology, and physiology and for his innovative studies of plant tissues. His most original contribution to medicine is contained in his <i>De Pulmonibus,</i> or ‘On the Lungs.’</p><p>“That work, originally published in 1661 as a pamphlet of twenty-three pages, is exceedingly rare. Written in the form of two letters to G. A. Borelli, his colleague at Pisa, it was reissued in 1663 in book form with Bartholin’s <i>De Pulmonum</i>. In the first letter, Malpighi showed that the pulmonary tissues are vesicular and that the trachea ends in bronchial filaments; this supplied the anatomic basis for respiratory exchange in the lungs. The second letter recorded his discovery of the capillary link between the arteries and the veins, which complemented Harvey's experiments and theory on the circulation of the blood. Malpighi later described the red blood cells as ‘fat globules looking like a rosary of red coral.’</p><p>“Another book, on the viscera, was first issued in 1666 as three essays—on the liver, the cerebral cortex, and the kidneys. Later in the same year, two more essays were added, on cardiac polyp and on the spleen. All of them are notable for their original descriptions of histologic structure, in which Malpighi was a pioneer. Here, Malpighi elaborated Lorenzo Bellini’s account of the uriniferous tubules and noted that the glomeruli are attached to the tips of the arterial branches, which have been called the ‘Malpighian bodies.’ His name has also been applied eponymically to the Malpighian bodies of the spleen and the Malpighian layer of the skin.</p><p>“His later studies on embryology and plant physiology, though carried out in Italy, were encouraged by the Royal Society of London, which also published most of his work. The illustrations in <i>De Formatione Pulli in Ovo</i> (1673) and <i>De Ovo Incubato</i> make him the founder of modern descriptive embryology. Better than those of all other contemporary embryologists, his detailed observations were also the first accurate reports of the development of the aortic arches, the head fold, the neural groove, and the cerebral and optic vesicles.</p><p>“This gentle, fair-minded man’s life was marred by the personal attacks of his former colleague Borelli and by a long-standing feud between his family and a neighboring clan.

He had returned to Europe by the time war broke out in 1792 and was made surgeon major in the Army of the Rhine. In this capacity, Larrey initiated the practices that mark him as a man with imagination and organizational ability. Under his direction, triage and first aid were performed on the battlefield; the critically wounded were taken to military hospitals in light one-horse carriages called ‘flying ambulances.’ Until then, ambulances had ‘never arrived in less than twenty-four or thirty-six hours, so that most of the wounded died for want of assistance.’</p><p>“In 1794, Larrey was appointed chief surgeon of the army bound for Corsica.

He reached the other side moments before the bridge was destroyed by artillery fire.</p><p>“Larrey practiced debridement of wounds and was one of the first to amputate at the hip joint, an operation that he twice executed successfully under battlefield conditions.

After postgraduate studies in bacteriology, he enlisted in the French army as a medical officer. While on a tour of military duty in Algeria in 1880, he took blood samples from acutely febrile patients suffering from malaria. In this way, by luck, he happened to be examining the blood of his patients at the time when the protozoan source of the disease was most in evidence. His first announcement of the discovery of the cause of ‘paludism,’ or marsh fever, was made to the Société Médicale des Hôpitaux de Paris. Thereafter, he continued his research on malaria for another twenty years and published four separate treatises on the disease in 1884, 1891, 1892, and 1898 as his knowledge increased. Laveran is also remembered for important contributions to military medicine and hygiene and for <i>Trypanosomes et trypanosomiases</i> (1904).</p><p>“Patrick Manson, who had already found that mosquitoes carry <i>Filaria sanguinis</i>, suggested that Laveran’s malarial parasite must be carried in the same way.

He had studied first at the University of Bonn, then earned his Ph.D. at Elangen, and continued his studies under Gay-Lussac in Paris. A pioneer in laboratory teaching and agricultural chemistry, he made his reputation as a pure chemist.</p><p>“In 1825, Germany lagged behind other European countries in the field of chemistry. Von Liebig, by creating the first teaching laboratory, inaugurated Germany’s era of brilliant chemical research. He became interested in the application of chemistry to agriculture and tried to introduce scientifically compounded fertilizers to replace local empirical methods of improving the soil. He was the first to suggest that overuse of the soil depleted its nutrients and that they should be replaced by nonorganic chemicals.</p><p>“His interest later extended to medical needs, and he became the first modern chemist to apply the specialized techniques of organic chemistry to physiology, pathology, and pharmacy. He studied many reactions, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats and the degradation of proteins and purines to urea, uric acid, and hippuric acid. Paradoxically, despite von Liebig’s inventive nature, he also was a conservative who could not accept Schwann’s demonstration of living cells in yeast and the biotic cause of putrefaction.</p><p>“Von Liebig wrote ‘Organic Chemistry in Its Application to Physiology and Pathology’ at the age of thirty-nine. The treatise was dedicated to the doyen of contemporary chemists, the Swedish scientist John Jacob Berzelius, although Berzelius had criticized him severely. It contains three main sections; the chemical process of respiration and nutrition; the metamorphosis of forms, which carries as a running title on each page, ‘The Chemical Process of the Change of Forms’; and the phenomena of movement in animal organisms, followed by discourses on the theories of disease and of respiration. The medical value of the book, beyond its somewhat theoretical formulation, consists in the clear explanation of the chemical process in respiration (including the importance of oxygen), the introduction of the concept of metabolism, with a classification of the organic foodstuffs. With these three sections, von Liebig laid the foundation of subsequent biochemical knowledge.</p><p>“Von Liebig’s resistance to the new living-cell theory and his conviction that all biologic processes could be explained as chemical reactions led him into some erroneous deductions, but his factual observations had lasting validity” (Waife et al. 197).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Liebig, Justus von, <i>Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its application to physiology and pathology</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/651449",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17891017,QP521 .L716 O68,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The work was not entirely original, because the clinical nature of the disease and the preventive properties of fresh fruits and vegetables had been explored by Lind’s predecessors. Nevertheless, his practical suggestions for including antiscorbutic foods in sailors’ daily menu8s during long sea voyages exerted a tremendous influence. His statements about the cause and cure of scurvy were not confirmed and elucidated until the early twentieth century, when the effects of vitamin C deficiency were precisely defined.</p><p>“While serving at sea as a surgeon’s mate in 1747, Lind carried out a controlled experiment on the diet of the sailors. Perhaps the first clinical trial, the study showed that citrus juice could prevent and cure scurvy. Six years later, after he had received a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh, Lind published this book. It presented a critical account of current opinion, demonstrating that the disease is not congenital, hereditary, or infectious; a description of the disease, its cause, prevention, and cure; and a digest of everything previously written about scurvy.</p><p>“The treatise describes Lind’s experiment.

From the time he took his arts degrees in 1655, he collaborated in the dissections on which Willis based his book on the brain, published in 1664. Lower was the first man to effect the intravenous transfusion of the blood (through a quill cannula) from one animal to another. The first human transfusion was performed by J. B. Denys in Paris in 1667, two years later; shortly after that, Lower made the first one in England.</p><p>“He received his medical degree in 1665 and moved to London, where he carried out physiologic research, was active as a member of the Royal Society, and practiced with great success as a physician. He tried to explain the function of anatomic structures through his experiments and, in dissecting the cardiovascular system, made significant observations that virtually completed Harvey's work on the heart.</p><p>“His book, <i>Tractatus de Corde</i>, is in five sections: the site and structure of the heart, its movements, the movements and colors of the blood, blood transfusion, and the chyle and its transition and transmutation into blood. Lower’s most original contributions, recorded in the book, were his concept of the heart muscle and his explanation of the heartbeat as a muscular mechanism, his description of the change in color of the blood from dark to bright as it passes through the lungs, and his conclusion that this was caused by the absorption of air. Soon after the observation, John Mayow, another Cornishman, made the correct observation that only part of the inspired air is absorbed by venous blood in the lungs.</p><p>“In a second edition, in 1670, Lower incorporated a chapter, ‘De Catarrhis,’ in which he showed that catarrh does not come from the pituitary, as had been believed, but is secreted in the respiratory passages of the nose and sinuses. It was courageous of him to oppose the traditional Galenic belief that even Vesalius had upheld. This discovery ended the practice of ‘purging the brain’” (Waife et al. 87).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7771978,    QM178 .L6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The work, which received approbation from Daquin, first physician to the king of France, contains the best summary of the knowledge and practice of obstetrics of the era. It is beautifully illustrated with copperplate engravings of birth figures and obstetric instruments and became a standard of excellence for book publishers in its time. Mauriceau (1637-1709) mentioned the several generations of the Chamberlen family, who had kept their obstetric forceps secret for over two hundred years. After the Huguenot Chamberlens had migrated to England, one of them, Hugh Chamberlen, translated Mauriceau’s book into English.</p><p>“The book has a long subtitle that recommends it as useful for surgeons and necessary for midwives.

He was a pupil of the famous Alcuin at Tours, where he adopted the name Maurus (a favorite disciple of St. Benedict). Later in life he became abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Fulda in Thuringia, Germany. Thanks to Maurus, Fulda achieved fame as a school where long-forgotten classical texts were copied, translated, and studied. Shortly before his death, Maurus became archbishop of Mainz.</p><p>“Hrabanus Maurus is regarded as one of the first medieval Scholastics. The term ‘philosophy’ was beginning to be applied to disparate aggregate of learning that was being rediscovered from the writings of classical antiquity. Thus, the period marked a cautious beginning of the great debate between reason and religious dogma.</p><p>“Maurus’ universal knowledge was renowned. In German lands, he became the leader of the first renaissance of art and learning in the western world under the Emperor Charlemagne. He is now remembered chiefly for his encyclopedic dictionary, <i>De Sermonum Proprietate</i> (c. 800), which contains one short chapter on medicine, then considered an element of philosophy. Six hundred years later, it was the first encyclopedia to be printed. It consists of twenty-two ‘books,’ or essays, combining some classical lore, moralizing, and theological doctrine, on a variety of topics. There are books on man and animals; countries and the world; water and the sea; earth and its composition; magic; stones and metals; measures, weights, and numbers; music; and drugs. Maurus’s work is bound with, and follows, <i>Concordantia Evangelistarum</i>, by Zacharius Chrysopolitanus.</p><p>“The section on medicine and diseases occupies only two pages and is a sermon on the subject rather than a factual treatment. It purports to define the physician's art, health, and sickness according to the four humors. It is interspersed with numerous quotations from the Bible and contains many generalizations, such as ‘health is bodily integrity and temperance,’ ‘immoderation brings danger,’ and ‘debility of body is debility of mind, as we read in the Book of Leviticus.’ Leprosy (the main disease discussed) is called a punishment for the spiritual blindness and deafness of heresy and blasphemy.</p><p>“By 1647, when the encyclopedia was printed, Maurus’s ideas had become antiquated. Medicine had made great advances in the later Middle Ages and was progressing even more rapidly in the beginning renaissance of science. Nevertheless, the early printers preferred such texts as this, which were famous and traditional rather than innovative, in view no doubt of their largely clerical clientele” (Waife et al. 15).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,BR 65 .Z3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Although there is no record of his having gained a medical degree, he studied physics and practiced medicine in London and in Bath and was familiar with Malpighi’s work. At twenty-seven, he published a small book, ‘Two Treatises on Respiration and on Rickets,’ in Latin. The second edition was ‘Five Treatises,’ containing the original two along with additional papers on ‘Aërial Spirits of Nitre,’ ‘Respiration of the Foetus,’ and ‘Muscular Motion and Animal Spirits.’</p><p>“The early essay on respiration is the most important of Mayow’s writings, for he demonstrated the part played by movement of the ribs in respiration; he first noted the double articulation of the ribs with the spine and the arrangement of the intercostal muscles that control the movement of the thoracic cage. He also observed that blood changes in color from blue to red during its passage through the lungs. He ascribed this change quite correctly to the taking up by the blood of a certain portion of the air, which he called the ‘igneo-aerial particles’ of the ‘aërial spirits of nitre.’ Mayow, it seems, had an intuitive understanding of the gaseous interchange that occurs during respiration between blood and the inspired air. Thus, he was very close to the discovery of oxygen. He may have owed the concept to Boyle but was certainly the first to demonstrate it by ingenious experiments. The identification and isolation of oxygen had to wait for Priestley and Lavoisier.</p><p>“Mayow showed also that animal heat is generated in the muscles themselves and realized that the maternal blood, besides nourishing the fetus, gives it ‘aërial spirits of nitre’ through the placenta.</p><p>“Mayow was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1678. He died the next year, still a young man. It is unfortunate that his writings, which were in Latin, were so unskillfully translated for the Royal Society that the English version could not be properly understood and hence was disregarded” (Waife et al. 83).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7230231,Q155 .M5,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

His graduating thesis proposed the theory that heavenly bodies act upon living beings by means of a subtle fluid he called ‘animal magnetism.’</p><p>“Mesmer came to believe in the therapeutic efficacy of iron magnets placed on the patient’s body or passed over it. During 1773 and 1774, while practicing as a physician in Vienna, he claimed that he had ‘cured’ some hysterical patients. He had done this, he explained, by utilizing the flux and reflux of magnetic currents in the body under the influence of hypnotic suggestion. In experimenting with magnets, he conceived the idea that similar power is possessed by the human hand. Anton Stoerck, the chief physician in Vienna, refused to believe Mesmer’s claims, and in 1777 Mesmer was ordered to discontinue this form of treatment and leave the city. He moved to Paris in 1778 and there erected a temple to the god of health, where, with a background of soft music, the purple-clad Mesmer would hold hypnotic seances, waving a magnetized wand. Although the afflicted thronged to his temple and his activities became a sensation, a commission was finally appointed to investigate the phenomenon. Among the examiners were Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier. The commission decided that magnetism was due to the imagination, Mesmer’s claims were denounced, and the clinic was suppressed in 1784.</p><p>“In self-justification, Mesmer published the book <i>Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme animal</i> in 1779. After an ‘Advice to the Public’ in his own favor, Mesmer records the case histories of the patients he had treated successfully in Vienna, with some account of his controversies. Twenty-seven theoretical ‘Propositions’ follow and provide a pseudoscientific basis for his treatment. These include statements that there is ‘a universal fluid susceptible of receiving, propagating, and communicating the impression of movement,’ although ‘up to the present its laws are unknown,’ that there are a ‘flux and reflux’ of this fluid in animal bodies, and that ‘I call this property of the animal body, which is analogous to the properties of the magnet, Animal Magnetism.’</p><p>“Mesmer’s work had minimum medical value in itself, but it seems clear that in retrospect he was curing psychosomatic ailments by suggestion. Ultimately, ‘mesmerism’ stimulated research on nerve impulses and influenced the rise of psychotherapy” (Waife et al. 135).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/2818014,BF1132 .M579,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Immunity, he suggested, fails wherever local or general conditions within the body impair or prevent this phagocytic response.</p><p>“In 1891, after ten years of research, Elie Metchnikoff expounded his theory of phagocytosis in a series of lectures. They were published as a book in French and in Russian the next year and translated into English by the eminent physiologist E. H. Starling in 1893. The work begins with a statement, ‘Infection is a conflict of organisms for whose understanding a study of comparative pathology is essential.’ Metchnikoff traced intracellular digestion through the animal Kingdom from unicellular forms to vertebrates, showing the phagocytic role of the leukocytes and the evolution of inflammation. He discussed chronic inflammation (with tuberculosis as its type), serous inflammation, and the antitoxic property of serum.</p><p>“Although the concept of immunity had been intuitively grasped by earlier works from Jenner to Pasteur, the new science of immunology was launched with Metchnikoff’s ‘Immunity in Infective Diseases,’ published in 1901. For his contributions, he was awarded many honors from around the world, including the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908, which he shared with Paul Ehrlich, the German bacteriologist” (Waife et al. 245)</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/18981174,RB131 .M486,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

An imaginative entrepreneur as well as a physician, he was the first to introduce the herbal products of Central America to the pharmacopeias of Europe. Although he never left Seville, Monardes obtained specimens of all plants imported from Central America and established a museum for them. Part of it was a botanical garden in which he managed to cultivate every plant that had been brought to him from the New World.</p><p>“Monardes was the first physician to write about the arrow poison curare and about tobacco, which the West Indians used medicinally. He imported tobacco in 1558 and was growing it in his garden in Spain while Sir Walter Raleigh was still a child in England. Monardes first described these drugs in 1565 in <i>Historia medicinal que trata de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias occidentales</i>. The book was then expanded and published in three sections, of which the Lilly collection contains the first. Its subtitle anticipates the second volume and reads (in translation): ‘Two Books. One deals with all things brought from our West Indies which can be used in medicine, and the other deals with the bezoar stone and scorzonera grass.’ A third section was published in 1574, and three years later all three parts appeared in an English translation entitled <i>Joyfull Newes Out of the New-founde Worlde</i>.</p><p>“Monardes recorded many native Indian plant names. He described the sacred wood guaiacum, thought to be a cure for syphilis; chinaroot and its cognate, sarsaparilla; and, more particularly, the purgative ‘white rhubarb.’ His second volume made a special impact on Europe because of its account of tobacco. He tells of its various medicinal uses—as a treatment for toothache and carbuncles and as an antidote for some types of poison. ‘Some time ago,’ he wrote, ‘some Caribbean Indians set out in canoes for San Juan de Puerto Rico . . . and they came to a plantation and killed a few Indians and Spaniards and wounded many. Since the foreigners did not have corrosive sublimate to cure them, it was decided to treat them with tobacco juice . . . and God willed that . . . the pains, ravings and fainting spells, from which they used to die, were relieved. Thus the power of the poison was removed . . . and the islanders, being acquainted with this cure, are now using it for wounds received when fighting the Caribs. And they are no longer afraid, for they have found such a great remedy for such a desperate menace” (Waife et al. 43).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7434649,RS169 .M5,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In fame and achievement, he was rivaled only by Boerhaave at the beginning of his career and by von Haller in his later years. Because Venice was at that time the most frequented city in Europe and the university town of Padua was nearby, Morgagni was accessible for consultation to a great number of patients. His earlier anatomic work appeared in the six series of letters of his <i>Adverseria Anatomica</i> 1706 and 1719. During the 1720’s, he published another series of letters commenting on the ancient Roman medical texts. He also edited the works of his master, Valsalva, with an elaborate commentary (published in 1740) running to more than a thousand pages, six times longer than the Valsalva material.</p><p>“Morgagni’s ‘Five Books on the Seats and Causes of Diseases Investigated by Anatomy, Comprising Almost Innumerable Dissections and Observations Now First Published for the Benefit of Physicians, Surgeons, and Anatomists’ is considered one of the great books in the history of medicine. Issued in Venice when he was seventy-nine, it appeared in two volumes and ran to some 850 tall pages with double columns of print. As though to guarantee acceptance throughout the learned world, each of the five ‘books’ is dedicated to a prominent physician or surgeon in a different city.</p><p>“Morgagni’s hundreds of case histories are correlated with necropsy reports in such a simple and attractive style that his vast collection remains one of the most readable of all medical books. The reports are replete with astute observations, and, in many cases, Morgagni described conditions that were not generally recognized until decades later. Especially noteworthy our discussions of cardiac valves (aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis), syphilitic aneurysm, pneumonia, and tuberculosis of the kidney. A number of eponyms have kept his name familiar to future generations; certain crypts, foramens, tubercles, sinuses, valves, columns, and other structures are associated with Morgagni.</p><p>“This monumental work may be said to establish the organ concept of disease and to make pathologic anatomy a major medical discipline. By coincidence, the book was published the same year as Auenbrugger’s major contribution on percussion.

His elder brother, Anton, also made his mark as a physician, and his younger brother, Joseph II, followed their father's calling and distinguished himself in care of the wounded after Waterloo.</p><p>“Franz Carl was first appointed medical officer to the institute for the poor at Elberfeld-Barmen in the Rhineland, where he reformed the administration and medical service. He became professor of medicine at the ancient University of Heidelberg and in 1810 was named, in addition, director of the Lying-in Hospital there, a post he held for forty years.</p><p>“Recognized as the best practicing obstetrician of his time, he improved the instruments of his specialty and made a number of significant contributions to the scientific literature. His papers on calculating the length of pregnancy and on the mechanism of birth provided a scientific basis for obstetric practice. He also wrote about various aspects of obstetric pathology.</p><p>“His most important work concerned the anatomy of the pelvis and the problems presented by pelvic and spinal deformities in cases of difficult labor. This book, ‘The Female Pelvis Considered in Relation to Its Position and the Inclination of Its Curvature along with Contributions to the History of the Knowledge of the Pelvic Axis,’ based on his measurements of hundreds of patients and postmortem studies, gave a new precision to morphologic knowledge. The book comprises two parts. In the first, fourteen short anatomic chapters are devoted to his measurements and calculations undertaken to establish ‘detailed knowledge of the form and conditions of all the points which constitute a well-made pelvis.’ The second part contains a critical history of all that had been written on the subject of the pelvic axis since the pioneer study by Hendrik van Deventer, of Leyden, in 1701.</p><p>“Naegele’s work not only was useful in itself but also set the example for much research during the next hundred years, which culminated in the classification of pelvic variations and their effects on labor published by the American obstetricians Caldwell and Moloy in 1933. Naegele himself published a study of the obliquely contracted pelvis in 1839. In his later years, he was assisted by his son, Herman Franz Joseph, who advanced the use of auscultation in midwifery” (Waife et al. 179).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RG519 .N32,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

As a young woman, she had sought the best training for a nursing career then available. She chose the Institute of Protestant Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth, Germany, where she learned both nursing and hospital and training-school administration.</p><p>“The need for radical reform in the care of the sick was made evident to Miss Nightingale (1820-1910) not only through her work in a London hospital but also through service in the barracks hospital in Scutari during the Crimean war.</p><p>“So effectively did she cut through ancient regulations in establishing a clean and efficiently run army hospital that, on her return to England, she was asked to establish a training school for nurses. The school opened at St. Thomas’s Hospital in 1860 with fifteen probationers, who lived at the hospital and were instructed by staff and visiting physicians. Graduates of the school were much sought after; many of them subsequently started nursing schools in England and the United States.</p><p>“<i>Notes on Nursing</i> was written with simplicity and direct common sense, enlivened by occasional sharp wit.

Young, poor, and alien, he was befriended by Simon Flexner, whom he followed to the new Rockefeller Institute in New York in 1904. His first work in this country was a study of all types of snake venom, their effects on the body, and the means by which snakebites should be treated. Noguchi elucidated the causes of many infectious diseases, studying in particular spirochetes and the vaccinia virus. In 1910, together with Flexner, he confirmed Schaudinn’s discovery that syphilis was due to <i>Treponema pallidum</i>. Three years later, by finding these spirochetes in an impressively large series of autopsy specimens, he was able to establish that tabes dorsalis and general paralysis result from advanced syphilis of the spinal cord and brain.</p><p>“His study of Oroya fever, establishing <i>Bartonella bacilliformis</i> as its agent and <i>Phlebotomus</i> as the vector, was a major contribution to tropical medicine. In his last ten years he worked on yellow fever; he succumbed to this disease soon after Adrian Stokes, who had discovered the causative virus just before his death.</p><p>“Dedicated to Simon Flexner, the <i>Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis</i> contains in its preface the statement that ‘the author endeavored to make it suitable for use by practicing physicians and students and at the same time with sufficient comprehensiveness to render it useful to laboratory workers.’ Noguchi explained in the first chapters how in-vitro hemolysis can be utilized to demonstrate antibodies in serum and how complement, antigens, and antibodies affect the hemolytic process. Later chapter provide step-by-step instructions for conducting the Wassermann reaction for syphilis and an appraisal, based on clinical and autopsy findings, of the value of that test. In the last chapter, Noguchi digresses to describe the butyric acid test, a simple procedure carried out on cerebrospinal fluid, which he devised for the diagnosis of advanced syphilitic disease of the central nervous system.</p><p>“Characteristically, Noguchi took pains to present every relevant detail on the subjects about which he wrote and included in his book a discussion on the quantitative relationships of all factors playing a part in the Wassermann reaction. As he put it, this was ‘an aspect of the subject that has not perhaps received the consideration that it deserves.’ The book sets an example of explicit thoroughness that few others have matched” (Waife et al. 255).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RC201 .N72,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Canadian by birth, he trained in medicine at Toronto and McGill universities, taught for twenty years at the University of Pennsylvania and at Johns Hopkins University, and then, during his last fifteen years, as regius professor of medicine at Oxford.</p><p>“He is remembered as clinician, pathologist, and historian of medicine; the personal magnetism he exerted on colleagues and pupils was widely spread by his <i>Principles and Practice of Medicine</i>. He wrote the book in fourteen months when he was forty-two, and it appeared in February, 1892. Meeting a widely felt need, it provided a rigidly systematized text on its internal medicine as well as relevant information from the great advances in laboratory sciences, particularly bacteriology, that had done so much to revolutionize medicine in the previous decades. Three thousand copies were sold in a month; through triennial revisions, the book became a standard text for students and practitioners over a period of thirty years, not only in English, but also in German, Spanish, French, and Chinese translations. Osler completed the eighth edition in 1912, and further editions were published for many years after his death in 1919. The chapters describe specific diseases by systems, a pattern since followed by most standard textbooks.</p><p>“Osler is also remembered for his research and infectious and cardiovascular diseases (e.g., Osler’s nodes, Osler’s disease), as a founding editor of the <i>Quarterly Journal of Medicine</i>, and as the author of <i>Aequanimitas</i> (1904) and <i>An Alabama Student</i> (1908). Both books address themselves to the philosophic, social, and ethical aspects of medical life. While at Oxford, Osler became curator of the Bodleian library. He was one of the greatest medical book collectors and the first to concentrate attention on the outstandingly influential books of successive centuries. He bequeathed his library to McGill University, Montreal, where he had graduated and held his first professorship.</p><p>“Osler’s warm and charming personality, his great skill as a physician, his innovative restructuring of the medical school curriculum, and his many significant writings have made him the most important figure of his time in both English and North American medicine” (Waife et al. 233).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RC46 .O8 1892,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Paracelsus (1493-1541) was both an academic and a rebel. After studying at Ferrara, he spent a number of years traveling throughout Europe, collecting information not only from academicians but also from alchemists, gypsies, midwives, astrologers, barbers, and executioners. In this way, he acquired a practical body of knowledge that was in many ways at odds with the traditional medical teaching of his time. Paracelsus was appointed professor of medicine at Basel in 1527 but held the position only one year. During that year, he publicly burned the ‘Canon’ of Avicenna in a campaign to reform medical teaching, lectured in German instead of Latin, and quarreled with the authorities over fees.</p><p>“The most original medical thinker of the sixteenth century, Paracelsus was perhaps the first to apply chemistry to practical medicine. He rejected the four humors of the Greeks and substituted three alchemical elements—mercury, sulfur, and salt.</p><p>“Paracelsus taught that medicine could not advance solely by clinging to established ideas but that there must also be ‘experimentation controlled by authoritative literature.’ He was the first to note the association between cretinism and endemic goiter, to suggest that syphilis—or, as he called it, ‘French gonorrhea’—might be congenital in some cases, and to recommend the use of mercury in its treatment. However, he accepted mysticism and occultism, not omitting the astrologic influences.</p><p>“His first book on surgical techniques was published in two volumes dated 1536. A pirated and unauthorized version of the first volume had been printed earlier in the same year at Ulm by Hans Varnier, who had armed himself with an imperial copyright privilege. Paracelsus justifiably defied this ‘copyright’ and, in his preface, energetically disavowed Varnier’s incomplete edition. He dealt with the complete treatment of wounds caused by piercing, shooting, burning, animal bites, bone fracture, and other injuries. Advocating sound surgical techniques, he also recognized the natural power of the body to heal.</p><p>“Disputatious and loud-voiced, Paracelsus spoke in the coarse words of a peasant rather than the refined language of his academic peers. In his last thirteen years, he resumed the wandering habits of his youth, practicing medicine and surgery throughout Germany. He died at the age of forty-eight in a tavern brawl in Salzburg” (Waife et al. 25).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7436048,RD93.P22 W96 1536,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

His books are notable for his vivid case histories, but he himself relied less on book learning than on his own experience and on learning by example. In his first work, a short treatise on the method of treating gunshot wounds (1545), he recommended that surgeons give up their traditional cauterizing of wounds with boiling oil, a treatment as dangerous as it was cruel. Paré’s second book, on anatomy, appeared in 1549, and by 1561 or 1562 he had completed another on the care of wounds and fractures of the head. His major surgical message, however, was detailed in two practical volumes, elegant in design but small enough for the field surgeon’s knapsack—the <i>Dix livres</i> (‘Ten Books’) of 1564 and the <i>Cinq livres</i> (‘Five Books’) of 1572.</p><p>“In <i>Dix livres</i>, Paré discussed war surgery, involving the treatment of gunshot and arrow wounds, fractures and dislocations, contusions, and burns; bone caries and gangrene; and urinary tract infections and strictures, kidney and bladder stones, and renal failure. There are many illustrations of instruments and appliances for reducing dislocations, a few illustrations of operations, and a picture of an artificial hand with articulated fingers.</p><p>“The <i>Cinq livres</i> of 1572 deal again with bandaging, fractures, and dislocations but also with animal bites, gout, and fluxions. They are illustrated with drawings of instruments, appliances, and ligatures.</p><p>“A year later, Paré published a similar volume, <i>Deux livres de chirurgie</i> (‘Two Books on Surgery’). The <i>Deux livres</i> discuss procreation and monsters and, in fact, concern obstetrics. Paré revived podolec version and had induced artificial labor in a case of uterine hemorrhage. Among his surgical innovations were an exarticulation of the elbow joint, the union of a fracture of the neck of the femur, and ligature instead of cauterization for amputations.</p><p>“All these works were published in 1575 in a single large volume containing the twenty-six ‘books’ of his <i>Oeuvres</i>. This compendium was later translated into Latin and several modern languages, including English.</p><p>“Paré’s medical writings, published without the permission of the Faculty of Medicine of the university of Paris and in the common tongue instead of learned Latin, provoked the anger of the physicians, who feared rivalry from surgeons. The physicians sought legal injunction against him in 1575, but he was again protected by the king, who had granted a ten-year privilege in 1572 ‘to employ such printers as seems good to him’” (Waife et al. 47).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7341072,R128.6 .P23 1572,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He recorded ten cases, differentiating paralysis agitans from other forms of paralytic disease, but remained in ‘uncertainty and indecision’ about the cause. He could neither indicate a cure nor suggest any useful treatment, because, he wrote, ‘internal medicines are scarcely warrantable . . . . all that art is capable of accomplishing is to check the further progress of the disease.’</p><p>“The little book has five chapter; the first defines the disease and illustrates it with six case histories. Chapter 2 contains descriptions of the two diagnostic symptoms—the ‘involuntary tremulous motions with lessened voluntary muscular power’ and ‘a propensity to bend the trunk forwards and to pass from a walking to a running pace.’ Chapter 3 differentiates shaking palsy from anomalous convulsion, disordered nervous control, and passive trembling. Chapter 4 suggests that the cause is some disease of the spinal marrow in the superior cervical vertebrae and the medulla oblongata. A case of convulsive policy following suspected injury of the spinal marrow is contrasted with four more case histories of the shaking palsy. The last chapter proposes bleeding or blistering at the neck in the hope of checking the disease. It is noteworthy that the book does not mention the characteristic masklike facies.</p><p>“Parkinson, a general practitioner in London, attended John Hunter’s lectures on surgery (and recorded them in shorthand). He was the first to report in English on a case of appendicitis with perforation. He wrote another book on medical education, <i>The Hospital Pupil</i>, which was well received after its publication in 1800.</p><p>“A political radical, he often engaged in agitations for reform, to the annoyance of those in government. He was an active pamphleteer, fighting for the disenfranchised, equitable taxes, legal protection of the poor, and other causes. He also contributed to chemistry, geology, and paleontology. His book on paralysis agitans remained the basic text on Parkinson’s disease until quite recent times and is still a masterful example of clinical description” (Waife et al. 171).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7435759,RC382 .P3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The following year, a German translation appeared—<i>Die Arbeit der Verdauungsdrüsen</i>. It is the German translation that is in the Lilly collection. Pavlov (1849-1936) was director of the Institute for Experimental Medicine in St. Petersburg when his book was published. By virtue of his ambidexterity and skill in handling laboratory dogs, particularly his operative formation of fistulas with intact nerve supply, Pavlov was able to acquire entirely new knowledge about the stimulation of gastric and pancreatic secretions. Discovering that the Vegas controls these secretions, Pavlov and his assistants next studied nervous reflexes and showed that they depend on reactions integrated in the cerebral cortex. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1904.</p><p>“Pavlov's book of lectures was soon translated into French and English as well as German. After a general survey of the subject and his methods, he described the output of the digestive glands in response to feeding, the vagal efferent nerve supply of the gastric glands and pancreas, and a general scheme of the reflex pathways involved, including their relation to the salivary glands and appetite. His most original observations are reported on the period of occurrence and the importance of the ‘psychic,’ or appetitive, juice and gastric secretion in contrast to the relative inefficiency of merely mechanical stimulation by food.</p><p>“After studying higher nervous functions, in 1912 he enunciated his concept of ‘conditioned reflexes,’ the effect of repeated sensory or psychic stimuli on reflex action. Pavlov used the term ‘telephone exchange’ in depicting the central-nervous-system connections between a dog's senses and the organs of digestion. By conditioning the animal, he was able to elicit salivation from the parotid gland in response to pain and the ringing of a bell. Furthermore, he found that the salivary reflex could be conditioned not only to discriminate between the frequencies of beads of a metronome above and below 100 per minute but also to distinguish one-eighth variations in the tone of sound vibrations within and above the range of human hearing.</p><p>“Pavlov's work continued after establishment of the Soviet regime, but he later resigned from several scientific organizations in protest against their political involvement.

In the Children’s Clinic at the University of Vienna, he studied infectious diseases and was the first to postulate that the incubation period ends with the formation of antibodies. He devised the tuberculosis test named for him, in which a small area of skin is scarified through a drop of tuberculin, and, with Bela Schick, he established the concept of serum sickness. Later he developed the theory of autoimmunity.</p><p>“His book on vaccination is the first work in immunology to involve the scientific analysis of a large series of clinical cases. It begins with a summary history of the hypotheses concerning reactions to vaccination and a statement of the objects and methods of immunization. The main text is divided into three parts: vaccination, revaccination, and theory. The first and second parts are based on the statistical evaluation of many case histories from the Children’s Clinic.</p><p>“The section on theory describes Pirquet’s concept of allergy and undertakes to explain the differences between early and delayed reactions to vaccination. After discussing pock exanthema and the agglutination theory, he points out the diagnostic value of ‘allergy,’ which he defined as ‘an altered susceptibility in regard to the whole group of pock diseases, had not an immunity in the strict sense.’ He further described it as ‘The bridge between hypersensitivity and immunity.’</p><p>“Although most of Pirquet’s career was spent in the medical centers of Austria and Poland, he came to the United States in 1908 and held the chair of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University for two years. Upon his return to Europe, he filled similar positions at Breslau and Vienna.</p><p>“Pirquet became interested in nutrition after 1910 and was a commissioner for food distribution during the famine in Vienna following World War I. In this capacity, he was credited with innovative programs to aid the starving infants, especially in providing them with an adequate milk supply. In his last years, he studied the allergies of old age and the role of aging in the incidence of cancer.</p><p>“Pirquet’s intellectual brilliance was marred by emotional instability. At the age of fifty-five, seemingly in good physical and mental health, he took his own life” (Waife et al. 251).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QR185 .P5,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

His graduation dissertation had concerned subjective visual phenomena, a topic he further explored in his three-part article published in 1825. Some of the findings reflect Purkinje’s experiments on himself after he had taken belladonna.</p><p>“Purkinje was a histologist and a physiologist. He was one of the most original of the young men in many countries who, by using up-to-date improved microscopes, were advancing rapidly in knowledge of living processes. He reported new observations on myopia, hypermetropia, and accommodation and on reflex eye movements, including nystagmus, while noting the impossibility of observing the inner eye in the living.</p><p>“In 1850, Purkinje returned to his native country as professor of physiology at Prague, a position he retained until his death.</p><p>“In preparing tissues for microscopic examination, Purkinje was the first to employ a properly focused light source of high intensity, a microtome, potassium bichromate, glacial acetic acid, and Canada balsam. Whereas microscopy had until then proven not much more than the means of magnifying tissue architecture, these contributions permitted the detailed study of the types of cells that characterize a tissue.</p><p>“While studying the structure of the brain, Purkinje noted those ganglionic cells that are peculiar to the cerebellum and are now called ‘Purkinje cells.’ Likewise, he was the first to describe the ‘Purkinje fibers’ of the heart. He introduced the word ‘protoplasm,’ invented investigative instruments such as moving recorders for the study of cardiac action, and gained an international reputation for his discoveries in cytology, embryology, and cardiology.</p><p>“Some of his important works were overlooked for decades because they were in his native Czech.  However, he himself was fluent in no less than twelve languages. Many of his significant discoveries were made in his home laboratory. Purkinje’s wide-ranging interests included the inventing of a spirometer and a hearing aid, a detailed study of fingerprints, and investigation of gastric secretion. In his spare time, he founded a journal of natural history” (Waife et al. 177).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QP475 .P9,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The book reflects an interest that Ramazzini acquired late in life; it was published in 1700, more than forty years after he had received his degree as doctor of medicine.</p><p>“Ramazzini’s concern with occupational diseases developed naturally from his studies of the environment as a cause of disease. The treatise covers the illnesses associated with forty to fifty different occupations, including general chapters on diseases of sedentary and standing workers and those of literary men. The first systematic survey of the subject, this book was reprinted at Utrecht in 1703, and an anonymous English translation appeared in 1705. At the age of eighty, Ramazzini revised the book; that expanded edition was published in 1713, the year before his death. He added new observations throughout, rearranging the second half of the volume and including a supplement of twelve new chapters on trades previously undescribed.</p><p>“Among his more astute observations are his accounts of the ‘phthisis’ acquired by stonemasons and miners (silicosis and pneumoconiosis), the eye problems of printers and gilders, the sciatica of tailors, and the lethargy of potters. Ramazzini pointed out that, in some lines of work, disorders can result from the strain of unusual physical demands or postures, such as those required of tailors; in other occupations, workers can develop disease from exposure to dangerous substances, such as lead or mercury. Ramazzini continues to be honored in Italy to this day by a medical journal that bears his name.</p><p>“Ramazzini was also interested in epidemiology. From 1690 to 1695, he studied and then described a severe Italian epidemic of malarial fever. He became greatly concerned about this disease, which was endemic near undrained marshlands, and promoted the use of cinchona bark, as Thomas Sydenham was advocating, saying that cinchona did for medicine what gunpowder had done for war. He studied the effect of weather on recurrence of diseases and published his ‘barometric diary’ in 1710, just as Sydenham’s follower John Locke had done in England in 1692” (Waife et al. 99).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7341309,RA787 .R14 1700,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He studied in Prague and Vienna, where he graduated in medicine, and then spent his entire career in the pathology laboratory. He and Josef Skoda, the clinician, were the leading founders of the revolutionary movement that became known as the New Vienna School.</p><p>“Having access to the great hospitals of Vienna, where he was professor of pathology in the university, Rokitansky became the most thoroughly equipped pathologist of his time. By decree of Emperor Joseph II, all patients who died in hospitals were to be autopsied. This allowed Rokitansky to perform some thirty thousand postmortems himself during his lifetime and to have available the findings of more than thirty thousand others.</p><p>“His ‘Handbook of Pathologic Anatomy’ provided the nineteenth century with a fund of pathologic observation comparable in scope to Morgagni’s in the previous century. The work is in three volumes, but they were published in reverse order. Volume III appeared first, in 1842, and dealt with abnormalities of the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems. Volume II, issued in 1844, contained sections on abnormalities of cellular, serious, and mucous tissues, the skin, fibers, bone, muscle, and the vascular and nervous systems. In these volumes were the first accounts of acute yellow atrophy of the liver and an improved concept of pneumonia. Congenital malformations were meticulously described. Volume I, containing the general survey, finally came out in 1846. Both volumes II and III were reissued without alteration, presumably because the publisher had underestimated their chances for success.</p><p>“Rokitansky’s observations and descriptions were original and impeccable. Some of his theories, however, especially his chemical hypothesis of tissue change, were misconceived and outdated. They were so sharply criticized by Virchow in the <i>Medizinicsche Zeitung</i> in 1846 that Rokitansky omitted them from later editions of his work. He has also been accused of divorcing pathologic from clinical observation and, with Josef Skoda, has been charged with encouraging therapeutic nihilism. Later in life, he published beautifully illustrated and detailed monographs on the pathology of the arteries and malformations of the heart” (Waife et al. 199).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RB24 .R6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Scarpa received his medical degree at the age of eighteen and, at twenty, was appointed professor of anatomy at Modena. Here he immediately published, with his own superb illustrations, a book on his discovery of the membranous labyrinth in the ear. When he was thirty-one, he moved to the more important chair of anatomy at Pavia, which he held for twenty years. In 1787, in addition, he assumed the chair of surgery and held it until 1812. He was equally distinguished as research worker, surgeon, and teacher; wrote well in Latin and Italian; and drew his own illustrations with skill.</p><p>“Perhaps his greatest achievement was his large atlas of ‘Neurologic Plates,’ illustrating the cardiac, cerebral, glossopharyngeal, and pharyngeal nerves. This was published in Latin in 1794. The text includes a general essay on neurology, with accurate criticism of illustrations published by earlier anatomists, such as Willis, Vieussens, and von Haller. The essay is followed by descriptions of his own plates, providing brief, precise comments on the nerves illustrated, with mention of previous accounts. The seven engravings are so large that some organs are pictured life-size. Engraved by Faustino Anderloni from Scarpo’s drawings, the plates are both accurate and brilliant in light and shade. The book offered the first detailed representation and description of the nerves of the heart.</p><p>“The author is best remembered for Scarpa’s triangle, an area bordered by the inguinal ligament and superficial thigh muscles. It was first delineated in his report on an operation for popliteal aneurysm.</p><p>“Scarpa’s anatomic investigations spanned a period of nearly sixty years and included comparative studies of the auditory and olfactory apparatus and the deep structure of bone. His surgical work covered masterly and influential research on the diseases of the eye, congenital clubfoot, aneurysms, hernia, and arterial disease. On each subject, Scarpa offered new knowledge with practical application for the surgeon and clear, well-defined illustrations.</p><p>“Scarpa became director of the Medical Institute at Pavia and continued his research and writing until a year before his death at eighty-one.

In 1847, the mortality of the first ward, which was staffed by medical students who moved freely from the morgue to the maternity wards, was 11.4 percent; in the second ward, staffed by midwives, who were not permitted to work in the morgue, the mortality was 2.7 percent. Semmelweis reasoned that puerperal fever was brought into the first ward by the medical students, who had been conducting postmortem examinations on cadavers in the morgue.</p><p>“A twelve-month trial was initiated to test his thesis. During that time, the medical students were required to wash their hands in a chlorinated lime solution before touching or examining a pregnant woman. At the end of the test period, the mortality in the first ward had declined strikingly and was slightly lower than that in the second ward.</p><p>“Semmelweis was not only a pioneer of asepsis in obstetrics; he recognized that puerperal fever is a form of septicemia. He was not the first to point out that puerperal fever is contagious; Oliver Wendell Holmes, in America, had read a paper on the contagiousness of puerperal fever to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement in 1843. Holmes and Semmelweis apparently did not know of each other’s work.</p><p>“Semmelweis’s theory was violently resisted by many orthodox obstetricians of the day, just as that of Holmes had been opposed in America. So strong was the opposition to Semmelweis that he returned to Hungary, where he became professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest and director of St. Rochus Hospital. In 1861, almost fifteen years after he had begun to document his observations, he published his treatise on ‘The Cause, Treatment, and Prophylaxis of Puerperal Fever.’</p><p>“Unfortunately, nearly half of the long book consists of a controversial survey of other men’s opinions of his work. He pursued the controversy in his scathing ‘Open Letters to Sundry Professors of Obstetrics,’ which appeared in three pamphlets in 1861. (Two of these exceedingly rare items are also in the Lilly Library.)</p><p>“The rejection, opposition, and controversy were more than Semmelweis could bear. In 1865, when he was forty-seven, friends committed him to a mental hospital in Vienna. There he died within two weeks from a dissection wound. Ironically, his death had been attributed to septicemia, a variant of the disease he had tried to eradicate during his professional life” (Waife et al. 219).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7256581,RG811 .S36,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

As a brilliant practitioner and pioneer advocate of the use of anesthesia in childbirth and surgical operations, he was one of the founders of modern obstetrics and gynecology.</p><p>“At the age of thirty-five, he was appointed physician to Queen Victoria in Scotland, but the event was overshadowed by another of greater importance to him. ‘Flattery from the Queen is perhaps not common flattery,’ he wrote a few days later, ‘but I am far less interested in it than having delivered a woman this week without any pain while inhaling sulphuric ether. I can think of nought else.’</p><p>“However, he was not satisfied that ether, with its unpleasant side-effects, was the best anesthetic possible and continued to experiment with chemicals. On November 4, 1847, he and two assistants tested a new one, chloroform, on themselves, and he was elated with the results. Almost immediately, he had the opportunity to deliver a colleague’s wife of a baby girl under the new anesthetic. Within two weeks, the twenty-three-page pamphlet, <i>Account of a New Anaesthetic Agent</i>, was published. (The Lilly Library copy is bound with three other pamphlets by Simpson on the subjects of anesthesia and childbirth.)</p><p>“Since midwifery, as then practiced, was based on the belief that labor pains were a ‘desirable, salutary, and conservative manifestation of life-force,’ Simpson became a focus of controversy. Although opposed by many of his colleagues on ‘moral’ and ‘religious’ grounds, he was the idol of his patients, who flocked to Edinburgh from throughout the British Isles. The debate with his peers began to die down only when, in 1853, Queen Victoria chose to take chloroform at the birth of Prince Leopold.</p><p>“Several instruments and gynecologic procedures were also introduced by Simpson, who held strong and farsighted theories that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient within the hospitals. During his busy lifetime, he published some two-hundred articles on medical subjects and found time to write about twenty more on another interest of his, archaeology.</p><p>“After twice rejecting offers of royal recognition in the form of a title, Simpson finally accepted a baronetcy. Upon his death from heart disease at the age of fifty-nine, his family refused the tomb in Westminster Abbey, because he had wished to be buried among some of his children” (Waife et al. 201).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7436081,RD81 .S5,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

But if this canal has been narrowed by cicatrices after extensive sloughs, or from other causes, then sunlight is absolutely necessary for every stage of the operation from first to last.</p><p>“During the War between the States, Sims, a Southern sympathizer, was in Europe. ‘In 1862,’ he wrote, ‘I voluntarily left my own country, on account of its political troubles.’ He introduced his successful methods in London and Paris, where he was entertained by Napoleon III and had the Empress Eugenie for his patient. ‘After three years in a most favourable position in the highest circles of practice in Europe,’ as he wrote in his dedication, he published this masterly account of his work, first in London and then in New York. It was soon translated into German and proved to be a major contribution to gynecology.</p><p>“The book is written in clear and simple language. After detailing his new method of uterine examination, Sims deals in eight sections with the physiology, anatomy, and surgery of the female pelvic organs, including an account of their pathology and abnormalities and the mechanism of conception. He also records a method of artificial fertilization that he had employed. The book is well illustrated and thoroughly indexed” (Waife et al. 225).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RG104 .S6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

During his career, he succeeded his father first as a physician to the Meath Hospital in Dublin and later as regius professor of medicine at the University of Dublin.</p><p>“As a boy, the younger Stokes often accompanied his father on archaeologic and scientific excursions into the Irish countryside and undoubtedly learned much about meticulous observation on these trips. At the age of twenty-one, while still a student in Edinburgh, he wrote <i>An Introduction to the Use of the Stethoscope</i>, the first systematic English treatise to follow Laënnec’s book of 1819. It is credited with giving significant impetus to acceptance of the stethoscope as a diagnostic tool.</p><p>“The masterly <i>Diseases of the Chest</i>, published when Stokes was thirty-three, was the fruit of twelve years’ experience and established his reputation. Intending it to meet the needs of the practicing physician, he simplified the descriptions and explained the principles, rather than the details, of treatment. He extended the studies of Laënnec and Corvisart on the physical signs and symptoms of pulmonary illnesses.</p><p>“After discussion of the diagnosis of thoracic disease, Stokes dealt in turn with disorders of the mucous membrane (including bronchitis in particular), the larynx, and the trachea; pneumonia; gangrene of the lung; and disease of the pleura.

It was illustrated with thirty particularly fine engravings by Jean Beaudeau, most of them on foldout pages larger than the pages of the book. It also contained a splendid portrait of the author by Boulanger. Vieussens was an untiring dissector, and his work revealed the structure and arrangement of the nervous system better than that of any predecessor in addition to recording new and correct observations. For example, he showed that the spinal cord was an independent structure, not merely an appendage of the brain, and he first defined the centrum ovale.</p><p>“The book, which is divided into three parts, discusses the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves. It was based on 500 dissections of postmortem material. The words ‘Editio Nova’ on the page indicate a new and original publication rather than a ‘new edition’ in the modern sense.</p><p>“Vieussens was physician to the royal court in Paris from about 1688 to 1698. During this period, he became interested in chemical physiology and was among the first to study the chemistry of the blood and saliva. His exploration of the heart and blood vessels was recorded in three volumes issued late in his life. He also published an important, though less original, monograph on the structure of the ear. His investigations on the cardiovascular system resulted in many new anatomic and pathologic observations—for instance, the correct structure of the left ventricle of the heart, the course of the coronary vessels, and the coronary sinus. He was the first to record the symptoms of aortic insufficiency and mitral stenosis, describing the character of the pulse and the pathologic features with clarity and thoroughness.

He was an active politician whose liberal sympathies led him into trouble with the authorities I n1848, the year of abortive revolution. Because of this, he had to resign his position at the University of Berlin and leave the city. He was forgiven later, asked to return, made professor of pathology at the university, and given the directorship of the Pathologic Institute, a position created for him. He served as a member of the Reichstag from 1880 to 1893.</p><p>“Virchow’s impressive list of achievements includes his observations and definitions of leukocytosis and leukemia and his descriptions of the many types of thrombosis and embolism, which he saw as a sequel to phlebitis.</p><p>“This book was the foundation of all subsequent work in pathology. Virchow accepted the theory of the cellular structure of living tissue that had been advanced by Schwann but disagreed with his concepts of protoplasm, the cytoblast, and the orgin of cells. He enunciated the dictum that ‘every cell arises from a cell’ and regarded the body as ‘a cell-state in which every cell is a citizen,’ disease being ‘merely a conflict of citizens in this states, brought about by the action of external forces.’</p><p>“The book was based on twenty lectures delivered in April, 1858, at the Pathologic Institute. Beginning with a survey of the development of the cell theory from Bichat to Schwann, Virchow discussed the physiology and pathology of tissues in general and went on to describe the cellular conditions of disease processes in nutrition, circulation, the blood and lymph, and the nervous system. In addition, he dealt with the cellular basis of disturbances in function, irritability of tissues, fatty degeneration and metamorphosis, inflammation, normal and pathologic regeneration, and the character of regenerated tissue. The book was revised several times, without marked alteration, and was translated into English by Frank Chance in 1860.</p><p>“Late in his life, many honors were bestowed on Virchow. He dedicated the Pathologic Museum in 1899 and gave it his personal collection of more than twenty-three thousand specimens, each of which he had personally prepared and labeled. On his eightieth birthday he received a gold medal from Kaiser Wilhelm II and, shortly before he died in 1902, witnessed the completion of the new Berlin municipal hospital, which is named for him” (Waife et al. 213).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7341355,RB25 .V8,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The younger Warren was trained in Londo, Edinburgh, and Paris; at Guy’s Hospital, he was a pupil of Astley Cooper, the greatest English surgeon among the successors of John Hunter. On coming home to America, Warren became his father’s assistant in anatomic research and teaching and in his surgical practice. He was surgeon to the Massachusetts General Hospital from its opening in 1821, was associated with it for thirty-six years, and enjoyed wide recognition as the outstanding American surgeon of the first half of the nineteenth century.</p><p>“In the course of his teaching, he realized the need for an anatomic atlas of the arteries. Accordingly, he had an accomplished medical artist, Josiah Foster Flagg, prepare copies of the artery plates from <i>Icones Anatomicae</i>, or ‘Images of Anatomy,’ which had been published by the renowned Albrecht von Haller between 1743 and 1756. Haller had improved upon his predecessors’ work by giving accurate representation of actual dissections; these varied, as always in nature, from the ideal which earlier illustrators had tried to show.</p><p>“Warren and Flagg did not work directly from the plates in Haller’s book but used an anonymous manual for dissectors issued in London in 1808. This little English edition, with Haller’s plates reduced in size, was published in St. Thomas’s Street, London, and was probably intended for the students of the United School of St. Thomas’s and Guy’s Hospitals, where Warren had studied. Flagg, a dentist and pioneer in the development of porcelain false teeth, was in a class by himself as a medical artist. He engraved the fifteen plates on wood and printed them in two colors to show the arteries in red against the surrounding tissues in black. They were the first anatomic illustrations in color to be printed in the United States.</p><p>“Warren revised the descriptions and added a general account of the arteries. This striking book is very rare; the Lilly Library copy is in its original covers.</p><p>“Warren also published <i>Surgical Observations on Tumors</i> in 1837, a work famous in its day, but he is now chiefly remembered as the first surgeon to operate on a patient under total anesthesia. This was in 1846, when he was sixty-eight. After his death, the family tradition was continued by his son, grandson, and great-grandson, all of whom were surgeons in Boston” (Waife et al. 169).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RD598 .W2,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Convinced that Jenner’s work was valid, Waterhouse obtained cowpox matter from England in 1800 and vaccinated his five-year-old son. Satisfied with the boy’s response, he vaccinated his other children and servants. A servant boy was then exposed to the disease in a smallpox hospital near Boston and proved to be immune.</p><p>“After receiving fresh supplies of cowpox matter from England in the early spring of 1801, Waterhouse continued the vaccinations and then reported on his work in a supplement to his first pamphlet. The supplement, on ‘the progress of the new inoculation in America,’ was much longer than the original publication.</p><p>“Among Waterhouse’s other projects was the writing of a popular book in which he warned young people against the evils of tobacco and alcohol. Eight editions of this book were published, including one in French and German. Waterhouse also lectured on natural history, botany, and mineralogy, first at Rhode Island College and then at Harvard University. In 1782, on his return from seven years’ study in England and Europe, he suggested the formation of a humane society and, three years later, helped draw up plans for such an organization in Massachusetts.</p><p>“Waterhouse became the first professor of the theory and practice of physic in Harvard’s newly established department of medicine in 1783. In 1810 he learned of a plan to move the medical school from Cambridge to nearby Boston. So vigorously did he oppose the idea that in 1812 he was forced to resign his professorship, a position he had held for twenty-nine years. The following year, he was appointed medical superintendent of all military posts in New England. While serving in this position, he is believed to have edited (or even written) a romantic narrative, <i>A Journal of a Young Man of Massachusetts</i> (1816). His last literary work was the editing, at the age of eighty, of John B. Wyeth’s <i>Oregon</i>, published as a deterrent to western immigration” (Waife et al. 153).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7435095,RC183 .W32 P96,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

With this contribution, he was entitled to be a member of the notable group of seventeenth-century anatomists that included Valsalva, Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek, and others.</p><p>“In his preface, Willis acknowledged the help of Richard Lower, Thomas Millington, and particularly Christopher Wren, who ‘with the singular kindness for which he is esteemed, made light of drawing many figures of the brain and skull with precise skill and his own highly trained hands.’ Wren’s plates are not signed, but he is credited with the drawing of the base of the human brain that exhibits the ‘circle of Willis.’ Since they show a wealth of detail, the plates are clearer than Willis’ text.</p><p>“The book is divided into twenty-nine chapters that are partly anatomic and partly physiologic; it included comparative studies. One chapter, for instance, describes the brains of birds and fish; another, the cerebral arteries ‘in the various animals.’ A plate shows human and equine carotid arteries as well as the rete mirabile and pituitary of the calf. The sequence of chapters covers the posterior parts of the brain, the cerebellum, the cranium, and the dura and meninges; the blood supply; and animal spirits and animal faculties. In the final chapter, the blood supply to the spinal medulla is traced.</p><p>“Willis moved from Oxford to London in 1666 and was successful in medical practice there for nine years before he died at the age of fifty-four. His important contributions to clinical medicine included differential descriptions of epidemic typhoid and puerperal fever and two books on nervous diseases. The <i>Pharmaceutice Rationalis</i> contained the materia medica of his time. Willis made an exhaustive study of urine and was the first to report that the urine of patients with diabetes mellitus has a sweet taste (distinguishing it from the urine in diabetes insipidus). Typical of his powers of observation is his report of a deaf woman who could hear only when a drum was beating. Her condition was named for him, <i>paracusia Willisii</i>” (Waife et al. 77).<p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7435772,RC340 .W7,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The drug was known to physicians but had been given indiscriminately; Withering not only pointed out the cases in which it could be prescribed with advantage but also determined the correct dosage.</p><p>“Withering graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1766. He began his career in the English Midlands, practicing as a physician first in Stafford and then, from 1755 to 1792, in Birmingham. There he was appointed one of the physicians to the General Hospital when it opened in 1779. Three years earlier he had published <i>Botanical Arrangement of All the Vegetables</i>, a monograph on British flora, which was widely studied; it was arranged according to the new Linnaean system, was often revised, and became a standard reference during the following hundred years. He also wrote an influential study of scarlet-fever epidemics in 1779. After 1784, Withering was attacked by tuberculosis and gradually withdrew from his very successful practice to devote more time to botany and chemistry.</p><p>“When Withering first used digitalis in 1775, he noticed that ‘lives wre hazarded by its unguarded exhibition’ or that, on the other hand, ‘a medicine of efficacy was rejected as dangerous and unmanageable.’ By the time he published his <i>Account</i>, he had ten years’ experience with the drug and could offer ‘rules and precautions’ for its preparation and administration. The main part of the text, some ninety pages, presents 156 cases from his private practice, followed by reports on eight hospital patients. The next section contains histories of similar cases sent to him by correspondents. The remaining pages contain ‘practical remarks’ on the preparation, dosage, and effects of the medicine, suggest rules and cautions, and, finally, discuss dropsy.</p><p>“Withering introduced digitalis as a diuretic in the treatment of dropsy. He recognized that certain individuals responded best to the drug, and his descriptions show that these were cardiac patients. However, it was more than forty years before Richard Bright differentiated cardiac dropsy from renal dropsy. Withering pointed out to colleagues, when they reported failures with the drug, that they were not following his rules but were giving excessive doses in unsuitable cases. His careful analysis made this powerful medicine safe for the treatment of heart diseases” (Waife et al. 139).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7431792,RM666 .D5 W6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.
