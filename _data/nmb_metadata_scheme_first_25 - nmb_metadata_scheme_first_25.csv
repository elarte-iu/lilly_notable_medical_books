Frederick Grant Banting (1891-1941) conceived an idea for achieving pancreatic control of diabetes almost by chance while working at London, Ontario, in 1920. J. J. R. Macleod (1876-1935), professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, an authority on carbohydrate metabolism, thought the problem intractable, because he knew of the unsuccessful research of workers in previous decades. Nevertheless, in May, 1921, he gave Banting financial support and laboratory space at the university and appointed Charles H. Best, a graduate student, to assist him. By August, they had produced a pancreatic extract that controlled the diabetes of a depancreatized dog; by January, 1922, they had made a crude extract from beef pancreas, and clinical trials had begun in human subjects.</p><p>“Macleod called in J. B. Collip, who contributed his biochemical expertise to purifying the new extract, Production of insulin in quantities suitable for clinical use was begun by American scientists in the laboratories of Eli Lilly and Company, and the practical treatment of diabetes was at hand.</p><p>“The first report on insulin research appeared in an article by Banting and Best in the February, 1922, issue of the <i>Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine</i>, and other journal articles followed. In January, 1923, Macleod and Banting recounted the history of the discovery in the Beaumont lectures given before the Wayne County Medical Society in Detroit, and these were published as a small book the next year. The first, delivered by Professor Macleod, was a historical review. It traced the development of knowledge about the pancreas from 1682 to the current time. The second lecture, also by Macleod, reviewed the Toronto laboratory experiments that led to the trial of insulin in man. The third and final lecture was given by Dr. Banting. After detailing aspects of the animal studies, he reported on the first clinical use of insulin in diabetic patients.</p><p>“Banting and Macleod were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1923. Banting shared his portion of the prize with Dr. Best, and Macleod divided his with Collip.</p><p>“The Lilly Library at Indiana University contains an outstanding collection assembled by J. K.

No one has done so much and so well in so short a time.’ Because, like the emperor, he had accomplished a great deal in only a few years, he became known as the ‘Napoleon of medicine.’ The emperor ordered that a bust of Bichat be placed in the Hôtel-Dieu.</p><p>“Working essentially without benefit of a microscope (then still unperfected), Bichat identified some twenty-one different types of tissues and showed that tissues from different organs are similar and subject to the same diseases. Modern histology may be said to have been founded by this young physician. He made animal experiments as well as clinical observations in his search for the ‘vital properties of each tissue’ but defined his thoughts in the negative statement, ‘Life is the sum of the forces that resist death.’</p><p>“Bichat laid the foundation for a biologic attitude to medical problems and influenced such successors as Laënnec and Bernard in France, Bell and Brodie in England, and Virchow and von Kölliker in Germany” (Waife et al. 157).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Bichat, Marie-Francois-Xavier, <i>Traité d'anatomie descriptive</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711259",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711250,QM23 .B6 v. 1 - v. 4,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

A professor of materia medica at Harvard from 1815 to 1855, he distinguished himself first as a botanist. He had studied under Benjamin Smith Barton, of Philadelphia, whose <i>Elements of Botany</i> (1803) was the first textbook on the subject published in the United States. Barton had proposed that Bigelow describe the flora of Virginia and Pennsylvania, but Bigelow, more methodical than cooperative, instead published the three-volume <i>American Medical Botany</i> (1817-1821). This comprehensive survey in six parts contained sixty plates colored by a special process he had invented. It was one of the first two American books issued with colored illustrations of plants. The other was that of William Barton, nephew of Benjamin Barton and also a professor of botany at Philadelphia, whose <i>Vegetable Materia Medica of the United States</i> came out at the same time (1817-1818).</p><p>“Bigelow went on to promote compilation of a national pharmacopoeia. The Massachusetts Medical Society had printed its pharmacopoeia in 1808, the first state issue of such a work, but Bigelow had wider views. He joined in a convention of physicians and botanists who met in Washington, D. C., to assemble the first <i>Pharmacopoeia of the United States of America</i> and was instrumental in having it published in both Latin and English in 1820.</p><p>“He continued his campaign by writing and publishing his <i>Treatise on Materia Medica</i> in 1822, which he ‘intended as a sequel to the <i>Pharmacopoeia</i>’ and as a convenient handbook of practice for the physician and the dispenser. The <i>Treatise</i> begins with an explanation of the classification of medicines according to their action. The main text is arranged in an alphabetical sequence of Latin headings, such as <i>Linimenta</i>, <i>Pilulae</i>, and <i>Tincturae</i>. He departed from custom by insisting on simplicity of nomenclature but provided a ‘Table of Synonymes’ which compared the terminology of the American pharmacopoeia with that of similar works.</p><p>“Thus, early in the development of the nation, Bigelow’s vision insured that the whole United States would have a single unified materia medica. Bigelow’s son, Henry Jacob Bigelow, became one of the great surgeons of his day, a pioneer in anesthesia and orthopedic surgery” (Waife et al. 175).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RS153 .B5,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Although the latter were intended as mere ornamental supplements, they constitute the first accurate delineations of some of the species shown. The book was clearly inspired by Vesalius’s <i>Fabrica</i>, but Cheselden pointed out that Vesalius’s illustrations were sometimes imprecise in detail. Cheselden used the camera obscura to assist van der Gucht with the drawings.</p><p>“Cheselden’s first book, on anatomy, was published in 1713 when he was only twenty-five, but it held against rival texts until the end of the century. In fact, the thirteenth edition was published in 1792. The book was intended for surgical students and was concerned almost entirely with the anatomy of the superficial parts and the extremities. The viscera, then not very accessible to the surgeon, are described rather summarily.</p><p>“His second book, published in 1723, concerned the newly introduced ‘high,’ or suprapubic, operation for stone in the bladder. Because this involved Cheselden in a priority dispute with the brothers James and John Douglas, in which he was wildly abused and accused of plagiarism, he evolved the lateral operation. In 1728, he restored the sight of a blind boy by iridotomy with a needle to form an artificial pupil. This remarkable achievement, in addition to its surgical merit, provoked much discussion of the philosophic and psychologic implications of visual perception.</p><p>“In addition to his surgical skills, Cheselden was a patron of boxing, an architect, and a draftsman. In the days before anesthesia, when speed of operation was a necessary attribute for all surgeons, he was notable among his peers for being able to perform a lithotomy within fifty-four seconds. His standing in eighteenth-century England can be inferred from Pope’s lines:</p><p>“‘I’ll do what Mead and Cheselden advise,<br>To keep these limbs and to preserve those<br>eyes’” (Waife et al. 107).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Cheselden, William, <i>The anatomy of the humane body : illustrated with twenty-three copper-plates of the most considerable parts, all done after the life</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711088",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15735982,QM101 .C524,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He was also a scholarly connoisseur of books and amassed a fine library.</p><p>“At the age of twenty-five, he followed Valsalva’s discovery of aural structure with a study of the fluids of the inner ear, <i>De Aquaeductibus Auris Humanae Internae</i> (Naples, 1761), in which he described the parts of the inner ear, established the existence of the labyrinthine fluid, and offered a theory of resonance to explain the process of hearing. He is also known for his careful account of the pathologic findings in the intestines of persons who had died of typhoid fever and for his demonstration that albuminuria can be detected by boiling the urine.</p><p>“<i>De Ischiade Nervosa Commentarius</i>, in fifty-seven chapters, was published when he was twenty-eight. It differentiated between two kinds of ‘sciatica,’ neurologic and arthritic, by showing that the sciatic nerve is involved with the former. Cotugno covered in great detail the symptoms and etiology of sciatica and also outlined his method of treating it. In the course of this account, he gave the first extensive description of the cerebrospinal fluid, which had been mentioned by Valsalva (q.v.) in 1692. Cotugno revised the book for three subsequent editions, and it was also translated into English (1785) and German (1792).</p><p>“Cotugno anticipated Richard Bright by more than fifty years in his description of nephrosis, wrote a useful book on smallpox (1769), and advocated the public control of tuberculosis. He lived to the age of eighty-six” (Waife et al. 129).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,QP375 .C7,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Dioscorides described more than six hundred plants and plant principles encountered during his army service in the lands around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The compendium, written in Greek, noted the plants’ botanic characteristics and their real or traditional medical properties. Almost one hundred of these plants still serve a pharmaceutical purpose today.</p><p>“Although opium had been in use for centuries, Dioscorides was the first to write about its virtues, to point out its great benefits in the relief of pain, insomnia, and chronic cough, and to note its dangerous effects, particularly those of overdose. He was also the first to describe the medicinal usefulness of aloes, ammoniac, aconite, and ginger. He invented the name ‘<i>hydrargyrum</i>’ (liquid silver) for mercury; he recommended iron for uterine hemorrhage and aspidium for tapeworm infestation; and he was the first to state the need for testing the purity of drugs. Among the methods he advised for detecting adulteration were drug solubility, specific gravity, and reaction to ignition.</p><p>“Dioscorides also dealt with animal and mineral products useful in medicine and discussed diet and wines. He suggested mandragora wine for insomnia and pain and specifically for analgesia during surgery. An astute observer, Dioscorides recognized family relationships between plants seventeen centuries before Linnaeus.</p><p>“By the sixth century, the poorly organized compendium had been rearranged alphabetically, illustrations of plants had been added, and a Latin translation had been made. The book was translated during the following centuries into most of the languages of the modern and ancient world, including Arabic in the ninth century. The first printed edition, a Latin version, appeared in Italy in 1478, and the original Greek text was published in Venice in 1499. The revival of the teachings of Dioscorides during the Renaissance laid the foundations for scientific botany and pharmacy. Unfortunately, because all plants were thought to be universally distributed, a great deal of time and ingenuity were wasted in trying to equate western flora with the plants described by Dioscorides” (Waife et al. 21).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Dioscorides, <i>Pedakiou Dioskoridou tou Anazarbeōs ta Sōzomena hapanta . . .</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1414291) ; Mattioli, Pietro Andrea, <i>Les commentaires de M.P.

After taking holy orders, the Reverend Dr. Hales served as curate at Teddington, a small parish in Middlesex, until his death. However, his labors as ‘perpetual curate’ at St. Mary’s-in-the- Meadows were overshadowed by his achievements in physiology and botany.</p><p>“Hales began his study of the circulation by measuring the blood pressure of experimental animals, such as horses and sheep; his manometer was a long glass tube, connected to the animal's carotid artery by means of the windpipe of a goose. The blood pressure was measured directly from the height of the blood in the glass column.</p><p>“Hales measured the volume of the ventricle by making a cast of the cavity with wax; multiplying this volume by the pulse rate gave the cardiac output. He computed the circulation rate and the velocity of the blood in capillaries, veins, and arteries. With simple but ingenious experiments, he explored peripheral vascular resistance and the complex interplay of pressure, flow, and resistance. His work was the first real advance in circulatory physiology since Harvey’s pioneer observations.</p><p>“Hales was equally adept at botanic experiments, devising new techniques to measure the movement of sap in plants and trees. The results of these experiments were published in <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> (1727). In 1733, after more than twenty years of experimentation, he consolidated the reports of his botanic experiments with those on the hemodynamics of the central and peripheral circulation (<i>Haemastaticks</i>) in two volumes of <i>Statical Essays</i>.</p><p>“In later years, Hales became involved with the social aspects of medicine. His concern over poor ventilation in slave ships and prisons led him to devise a root ventilator that could be operated by hand or by a windmill. He campaigned for temperance and was influential in the passage of the Gin Act of 1736.

Hunter was an inspired teacher; his school of anatomy attracted men who became famous anatomists and surgeons. Among the latter was his brother John, who was ten years his junior. William Hunter’s home housed not only the school of anatomy but also a museum for his collections—books and manuscripts, paintings, coins, medals, and anatomic and pathologic specimens. These collections were later bequeathed to the University of Glasgow, where Hunter had studied for five years.</p><p>“Hunter spent almost twenty-five years preparing <i>The Anatomy of the Gravid Human Uterus</i>, the most magnificent obstetric atlas ever published. He engaged the best artists to draw and engrave the thirty-four illustrations, and it was printed by John Baskerville, the finest printer of the age, at the peak of his career. The life-size line engravings, many measuring 54 by 56 centimeters, achieve effects of depth and contrast without losing sharpness of detail and present a wide range of normal and pathologic conditions of the womb and fetus. Each page of text is printed in two columns, one in Latin and the other in English.</p><p>“William and his brother John explored the anatomy of the placenta and described the separate circulatory systems of the mother and the fetus. The brothers later quarreled over who should receive recognition for this work and separated professionally about three years before William’s death.</p><p>“William Hunter was the first to describe retroversion of the uterus (1770). Outside the field of obstetrics, he is remembered for the first description of arteriovenous aneurysm and for clarifying the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatics. He was professor of anatomy in the Royal Academy and a Fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian societies.</p><p>“Hunter never married. A hardworking, disciplined man who lived simply and frugally, he was troubled by severe attacks of gout, a disease that also affected other members of his family.

Probably the first to employ the microscope in the investigation of disease was the Jesuit priest of Fulda, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), contemporary with but slightly older than van Leeuwenhoek. This learned man was a virtuoso musician, orientalist, mathematician, and physicist and had some knowledge of medicine. His study of plague is valuable for its well-understood and carefully explained theory of <i>contagium vivum</i> or the infection by living matter. In his <i>Scrutinium</i>, published in Rome in 1658, he describes his studies on putrefaction, during which he saw maggots and other creatures develop in necrotic tissue. He found the blood of plague patients full of ‘little worms which propagate plague, so very small and unperceivable except with a very fine microscope.’</p><p>“This description occurs in the central section of his book, where he dealt with the ‘contagion or kindling of plague’ at some length. The earlier chapters discussed the causes and effects of plague, its prognosis, and the signs of its course, with some experiments on infected air. After the chapter on contagion, there is a thorough account of ‘therapeutics and prophylaxis, or the cure and preservation from contagion of the plague.’</p><p>“It seems unlikely that Kircher could have seen bacilli in the blood of plague patients with the simple low-power microscope available at the time. What he actually saw is less important than his realization of the association between disease and bacteria. Though he was probably wrong in identifying the objects under his crude microscope, his concepts led to a correct appreciation of the cause of infectious disease.</p><p>“The last twenty pages of his book provide a chronologic table of historic plague epidemics, including the Great Plague of Athens (430 B.C.) and the Black Death (A.D. 1350)” (Waife et al. 71).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Kircher, Athanasius, <i>L'autobiographie d'Athanasius Kircher : l'écriture d'un jésuite entre vérité et invention au seuil de l'oeuvre</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9284483",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17892625,QR201 .P5 K58,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Lancisi responded with the treatise <i>De Subtaneis Mortibus</i> (‘On Sudden Death’), published in 1707. In the first half of the book he dealt with sudden death in general, attributing it to three causes—‘suffocation from intemperance,’ syncope, and apoplexy. More important, however, were the sections on heart disease, because here Lancisi laid the foundations of cardiac pathology. He described such conditions as cardiac syphilis, which had not previously been identified, and provided a classification of heart disease. Hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart were presented as manifestations of cardiac disease, and the existence of valvular vegetations was discussed for the first time. Lancisi’s observations on heart disease were based on cases he had seen in his practice in Rome and include reports of autopsies in five fatal cases.</p><p>“Lancisi died in 1720, but his later researches on the heart, with an important treatise on aneurysm, were published in 1728 by his former assistant, Francesco Soldati.

He had studied first at the University of Bonn, then earned his Ph.D. at Elangen, and continued his studies under Gay-Lussac in Paris. A pioneer in laboratory teaching and agricultural chemistry, he made his reputation as a pure chemist.</p><p>“In 1825, Germany lagged behind other European countries in the field of chemistry. Von Liebig, by creating the first teaching laboratory, inaugurated Germany’s era of brilliant chemical research. He became interested in the application of chemistry to agriculture and tried to introduce scientifically compounded fertilizers to replace local empirical methods of improving the soil. He was the first to suggest that overuse of the soil depleted its nutrients and that they should be replaced by nonorganic chemicals.</p><p>“His interest later extended to medical needs, and he became the first modern chemist to apply the specialized techniques of organic chemistry to physiology, pathology, and pharmacy. He studied many reactions, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats and the degradation of proteins and purines to urea, uric acid, and hippuric acid. Paradoxically, despite von Liebig’s inventive nature, he also was a conservative who could not accept Schwann’s demonstration of living cells in yeast and the biotic cause of putrefaction.</p><p>“Von Liebig wrote ‘Organic Chemistry in Its Application to Physiology and Pathology’ at the age of thirty-nine. The treatise was dedicated to the doyen of contemporary chemists, the Swedish scientist John Jacob Berzelius, although Berzelius had criticized him severely. It contains three main sections; the chemical process of respiration and nutrition; the metamorphosis of forms, which carries as a running title on each page, ‘The Chemical Process of the Change of Forms’; and the phenomena of movement in animal organisms, followed by discourses on the theories of disease and of respiration. The medical value of the book, beyond its somewhat theoretical formulation, consists in the clear explanation of the chemical process in respiration (including the importance of oxygen), the introduction of the concept of metabolism, with a classification of the organic foodstuffs. With these three sections, von Liebig laid the foundation of subsequent biochemical knowledge.</p><p>“Von Liebig’s resistance to the new living-cell theory and his conviction that all biologic processes could be explained as chemical reactions led him into some erroneous deductions, but his factual observations had lasting validity” (Waife et al. 197).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Liebig, Justus von, <i>Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its application to physiology and pathology</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/651449",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17891017,QP521 .L716 O68,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Although the mortality in the series was 1.6 percent, he wrote that ‘among the last 121 cases there was no death.’</p><p>“When this book appeared, he had already published many other influential surgical texts and articles, including a large volume on <i>Abdominal Operations</i>.</p><p>“Moynihan was a man of abounding, masterful vitality. As professor of surgery at the University of Leeds in England, he had great technical skill, good judgment, and vision. If, while operating, surgeons would seek causes for all their patients’ symptoms, he maintained, possibly they would discover more about disease than do pathologists by autopsy.</p><p>“He wrote and spoke with clarity and was an able organizer and an enthusiastic encourager of cooperative effort and continuous education. He founded the <i>British Journal of Surgery</i> and played a major role in surgical training in England. Honors came to him in abundance for his many contributions to surgical diagnosis and to the operative treatment of abdominal disease and for his great abilities as a teacher and medical administrator. He became president of the Royal College of Surgeons, received a knighthood, and later, as Baron Moynihan of Leeds, became the first practicing physician since Lister to enter the House of Lords” (Waife et al. 257).</p>",Lilly Library,stillimage,[To be added],Not in IUCAT,RC862 .M8 1910,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

As a young woman, she had sought the best training for a nursing career then available. She chose the Institute of Protestant Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth, Germany, where she learned both nursing and hospital and training-school administration.</p><p>“The need for radical reform in the care of the sick was made evident to Miss Nightingale (1820-1910) not only through her work in a London hospital but also through service in the barracks hospital in Scutari during the Crimean war.</p><p>“So effectively did she cut through ancient regulations in establishing a clean and efficiently run army hospital that, on her return to England, she was asked to establish a training school for nurses. The school opened at St. Thomas’s Hospital in 1860 with fifteen probationers, who lived at the hospital and were instructed by staff and visiting physicians. Graduates of the school were much sought after; many of them subsequently started nursing schools in England and the United States.</p><p>“<i>Notes on Nursing</i> was written with simplicity and direct common sense, enlivened by occasional sharp wit. After an introductory chapter in which she stated that ‘nursing ought to assist the reparative process of disease,’ she discussed the conditions necessary for good nursing: ventilation and warmth; the ‘health of the house,’ or domestic hygiene; management (‘being in charge means that the work you do is not undone when your back is turned’); freedom from noise; selection of food; bed and bedding; personal cleanliness and the cleanliness of rooms and walls; and observation of the sick. In conclusion, she pointed out that her rules for nursing the sick applied even more to the care of children and puerperant women. In an appendix, she added statistics on the number of nurses employed at that time in England.</p><p>“A disciple of the pioneer Belgian statistician, Adolphe Quetelet, Florence Nightingale supported all her writings with statistical evidence; she was the first to display this material in colored diagrams with proportioned areas. Notes on Nursing is one of the seminal books of the modern world. It was published a few weeks after another significant work, Darwin’s <i>Origin of Species</i>” (Waife et al. 215).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Nightingale, Florence, <i>Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army . . .</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/16241833 ; Nightingale, Florence, <i>Army sanitary administration and its reform under the late Lord Herbert</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/16241857",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/19522868,RT40.N68 N54 1860,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He described the course of the disease in many individual patients whom he attended; he discussed the causes of the disease’s rise and decline; and he recounted the controversies among physicians concerning the correct methods of combating the spread of the epidemic and of treating the sick. Rush (1745-1813) printed the texts of notices issued by the city’s government and the College of Physicians, with letters he and other physicians had written to the papers, and he set forth the psychologic as well as the physical ravages of the disease as he himself experienced them and observed them in his own family.

Scarpa received his medical degree at the age of eighteen and, at twenty, was appointed professor of anatomy at Modena. Here he immediately published, with his own superb illustrations, a book on his discovery of the membranous labyrinth in the ear. When he was thirty-one, he moved to the more important chair of anatomy at Pavia, which he held for twenty years. In 1787, in addition, he assumed the chair of surgery and held it until 1812. He was equally distinguished as research worker, surgeon, and teacher; wrote well in Latin and Italian; and drew his own illustrations with skill.</p><p>“Perhaps his greatest achievement was his large atlas of ‘Neurologic Plates,’ illustrating the cardiac, cerebral, glossopharyngeal, and pharyngeal nerves. This was published in Latin in 1794. The text includes a general essay on neurology, with accurate criticism of illustrations published by earlier anatomists, such as Willis, Vieussens, and von Haller. The essay is followed by descriptions of his own plates, providing brief, precise comments on the nerves illustrated, with mention of previous accounts. The seven engravings are so large that some organs are pictured life-size. Engraved by Faustino Anderloni from Scarpo’s drawings, the plates are both accurate and brilliant in light and shade. The book offered the first detailed representation and description of the nerves of the heart.</p><p>“The author is best remembered for Scarpa’s triangle, an area bordered by the inguinal ligament and superficial thigh muscles. It was first delineated in his report on an operation for popliteal aneurysm.</p><p>“Scarpa’s anatomic investigations spanned a period of nearly sixty years and included comparative studies of the auditory and olfactory apparatus and the deep structure of bone. His surgical work covered masterly and influential research on the diseases of the eye, congenital clubfoot, aneurysms, hernia, and arterial disease. On each subject, Scarpa offered new knowledge with practical application for the surgeon and clear, well-defined illustrations.</p><p>“Scarpa became director of the Medical Institute at Pavia and continued his research and writing until a year before his death at eighty-one.

Instead, Sydenham’s contribution was the reintroduction of the Hippocratic method of careful clinical observation based on wide personal experience. As a recorder of the natural history of disease, he had few equals. For example, even today one can read his description of an acute attack of gout with profit and pleasure.</p><p>“His medical education was interrupted twice by military service under Cromwell. Although his formal edication in medicine was somewhat limited, he was a most successful clinician. Conservative and even distrustful of scientific innovations, Sydenham approached the treatment of disease with empiricism. His personal influence was so strong that most of the leading clinicians of the next generation may be considered directly or indirectly his pupils. His contributions, however, were not truly appreciated until after his death, when he came to be known as the ‘English Hippocrates.’</p><p>“It is interesting that the original <i>Observations</i> were written in English and published in 1676. The translation into Latin (the proper language of science at the time) was printed nine years later by John Mapletoft, to whom Sydenham dedicated the book. It includes sections on diseases, especially those seen in London epidemics between 1661 and 1675, and the characteristics and treatment of continuous and intermittent fevers, for which he introduced cinchona bark into general use in England. He discussed ‘pest’ (bubonic plague) and smallpox, recommending a regimen of cooling drinks for the latter, and described cholera, dysentery, bilious colic, epidemic cough, pleurisy, pneumonia and ‘false pneumonia,’ rheumatism, and quinsy.</p><p>“Although Sydenham’s notions of the causes of fevers and epidemics were traditional (he believed in ‘epidemic constitutions’ and the influence of atmospheric ‘miasma’), he did note the rhythmic periodicity of the recurrence of epidemics. He also recognized precise ‘species’ of disease, made a distinction between smallpox and measles, and gave the first diagnostic account of scarlatina. He continued to advocate bloodletting in moderation, but his other treatments were simple and sensible: fresh air in the sickroom, exercise for consumptives, iron tonics for anemia, and liquid opiates (laudanum) for pain.</p><p>“Sydenham gained fame through his ‘Treatise on Gout and Dropsy’ (1683), in which he differentiated gout from rheumatism, but his most enduring work was the <i>Observationes Medicae</i>. His classic account of hysteria appears in <i>Dissertatio Epistolaris</i> (1682)” (Waife et al. 89).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Sydenham, Thomas, <i>Dr. Thomas Sydenham, 1624-1689; his life and original writings</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9284555",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/18049961,R114 .S9 1685,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

It was illustrated with thirty particularly fine engravings by Jean Beaudeau, most of them on foldout pages larger than the pages of the book. It also contained a splendid portrait of the author by Boulanger.

In differentiating the glands from the viscera, he also explained their relationship. His name has been particularly associated with the duct of the submaxillary salivary gland, called ‘Wharton’s duct,’ and he accurately expounded the role of saliva in mastication and digestion. Even more valuable were his descriptions of the ‘renal glands’ (adrenals) and the thyroid, to which he gave the first adequate treatment, providing its name, ‘thyroid’ (shield-shaped), in place of the former vague ‘laryngeal gland.’</p><p>“His explanations were sometimes teleologic, as when he stated that the purpose of the thyroid was, among other functions, to fill the neck and make it shapely. Elsewhere he attempted a physiologic judgment, suggesting, for instance, that the adrenals act ‘to restore to the veins some humors imbibed from the spleen which were not profitable to the nerves.’ He gave a good account of the spleen and pancreas and furnished the original description of the mucoid matrix (Wharton’s jelly), which keeps the umbilical cord supple and cushions the fetal vessels.</p><p>“The book is arranged in the traditional order (abdominal, thoracic, and cephalic), to which Wharton added a section on the reproductive glands. He worked closely with his colleagues at St. Thomas’ Hospital and with Francis Glisson (q.v.); like Glisson, he stayed in London through the plague but lost his house in the Great Fire of London in 1666.

He named eight categories according to the appearance of the skin: popular, squamous, exanthematous, bullous, vesicular, pustular, tubercular, and macular. The nomenclature was compiled from Greek, Latin, and Arabic terms. This classification, presented to the Medical Society of London, won him the Fothergillian gold medal in 1790. It was generally adopted in English-speaking countries and is largely in use at the present time.</p><p>“Willan intended this book to be the first volume in a definitive series on dermatology, but it was the only volume the author managed to complete before his death at the age of fifty-five. The contents, originally published serially, covered only part of the classification proposed in the introduction. His student, Thomas Bateman, continued the description in a work published in 1817, which also contains a series of Willan’s engravings.</p><p>“He made many original observations, describing for the first time or providing the first clear differentiation of such disease entities as impetigo, lupus, psoriasis (sometimes known as Willan’s syndrome), scleroderma, ichthyosis, sycosis, and pemphigus.</p><p>“Willan was an early supporter of Edward Jenner, whose announcement of vaccination was published in the summer of 1798, about the same time as the first part of Willan’s <i>On Cutaneous Diseases</i>. Jenner had drawn Willan’s attention to the ‘entanglement’ of cowpox herpes, the effect of one virus on another in the same host. Willan himself published a treatise entitled <i>On Vaccine Inoculuation</i> in 1806, which strongly advocated compulsory vaccination.</p><p>“He was an accomplished scholar in Latin and Greek, and perhaps that is why certain relatively unfamiliar terms are still used in dermatology. He was also greatly concerned with the sick and indigent and worked to improve the public health of his time.</p><p>“Although Willan’s purely descriptive pathology was superseded by the more profound ‘morbid anatomy’ introduced in his lifetime by Matthew Baillie (q.v.), his book remains one of the foundation stones of modern dermatologic knowledge” (Waife et al. 161).</p>","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Willan, Robert, <i>On vaccine inoculation</i>, https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9671524",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9162319,RL61 .W6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.
