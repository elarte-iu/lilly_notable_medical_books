## About the Collection

The *Notable Medical Books Repository* is intended to be an engaging way to showcase the 130 books from J.K. Lilly Jr.'s collection, and to allow curious browsers of all backgrounds easier access to information regarding these titles, and encouraging them to check them out in person. Though only descriptions and images of 27 of the books have been uploaded to the site at present, all are projected to find their way onto this site by Q2 2025. 

I am a Curatorial Assistant at the Lilly Library, where this collection is housed. The Curator of Dermatology, General Medicine, and Science, Erin Chiparo, has given me permission to use this collection for my project and to upload representations of the entire collection to this site after the course concludes. Having put a lot of effort into reassembling this collection physically, I would love to help it receive greater appreciation by the public. I think creating a digital repository like this can bring attention to the books in a fun and effective way, as well as being a valuable example for the Lilly of what other collections or snapshots of past exhibitions would look like hosted on CollectionBuilder sites.

The item description in this repository has been lifted from the book *Notable Medical Books From the Lilly Library* edited by S.O. Waife, Elizabeth McCain, Ruth Weber, and Charles E. Hammond, and prepared by William R. LeFanu, Emeritus Librarian of the Royal College of Surgeons of London, England. Published in 1976, it is currently out of print, which is a shame—the remarkable amount of care and research put into each entry they wrote on the subject of the books in the collection provides great insight into each author's contributions and the times in which they lived. On their own motivations on undertaking this former project, S.O. Waife had this to say:

> <p>“This volume, then, is only a partial record of special treasures in the Lilly Library at Indiana University. It does not aim to be a full survey of medical literature, still less a history of medicine. It samples great discoveries as recorded by those who made them. The history of medicine is preserved in the written word, but carry the mark of their authors' character and personality. Therefore, an attempt has been made to include here a brief account of each author's life and his other work and to provide a historical framework for the contribution he made to medical knowledge. […]</p>

> <p>“Notable Medical Books is a tribute to the scholarship and generosity of J.K. Lilly, Jr., who was personally responsible for collecting works of primary significance for the story of medicine and who presented his acquisitions to Indiana University to attract others—as he had been attracted—to study and appreciation of the past” (Waife et al. 9).</p>


## Roadmap

Within the following months, these changes and updates are projected to take place on this webpage:

* Updates to the repository that contain transcriptions of the remainder of entries in *Notable Medical Books from the Lilly Library, Indiana University*, and corresponding photographs of the rest of the collection (or digitization of key illustrations and pages, if possible). 
* Further original research conducted on each title; refinement of included information from *Notable Medical Books*.
* The creation of buttons allowing patrons to request to see a book directly from its page (pending Library staff agreement).
* Better integration with IUCAT; allow IUCAT search from browse or specialized browsing page.


## Special Thanks

<p>A huge thank you to Prof. John Walsh and Gyuri Kang, for their patience, availability, and excellent instruction.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Erin Chiparo for permission to partially "digitize" the Notable Medical Books collection, and for her support and enthusiasm for the project.</p>

<p>The depth of information provided in each entry would not have been possible without S.O. Waife et al.'s excellent scholarship and research epitomized in their 1976 publication.</p>
