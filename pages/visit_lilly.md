## Planning Your Visit

The normal hours of operation of the Lilly Library are as follows:

<p style="text-align: center;">Monday - Thursday: 9:30 am - 5:30 pm<br>
Friday: 9:30 am - 5 pm<br>
Saturday: 10 am - 4 pm<br>
Sunday: Closed</p>

Hours are subject to change; make sure to check <a href="https://elarte-iu.github.io/lilly_notable_medical_books/visit-the-lilly.html">the Lilly's calendar</a> to ensure you don't accidentally plan to come at a time when we are closed!

The most reliable way to ensure you're able to see books of interest from this collection is to put in a request to see them during a visit to our Reading Room. All are welcome to make an appointment, but you must create an account to use the Lilly Library's request system (see section below), and must bring a form of valid photo-identification with you on the day of your visit. If you intend to use the Reading Room, please <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/lilly-library/ask">let Lilly staff know</a> of your plans two weeks prior to your visit.
